IP Geo Block
==============

It blocks any spams, login attempts and malicious access to the admin area 
posted from outside your nation, and also prevents zero-day exploit.

There are some cases of a site being infected. The first one is the case 
that contaminated files are uploaded via FTP or some kind of uploaders. 
In this case, scaning and verifing integrity of files in your site is useful 
to detect the infection.

The second one is cracking of the login username and password. In this case, 
the rule of right is to strengthen the password.

The third one is caused by malicious access to the core files. The major issue 
in this case is that a plugin or theme in your site can potentially has some 
vulnerability such as XSS, CSRF, SQLi, LFI and so on. For example, if a plugin 
has vulnerability of Local File Inclusion (LFI), the attackers can easily 
download the `wp-config.php` without knowing the username and password by 
simply hitting 
    [wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=show&file=../wp-config.php](http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/09/slider-revolution-plugin-critical-vulnerability-being-exploited.html "Slider Revolution Plugin Critical Vulnerability Being Exploited | Sucuri Blog")
on their browser.

For these cases, the protection based on the IP address is not a perfect 
solution for everyone. But for some site owners or some certain cases such 
as 'zero-day attack', combination with WP-ZEP can still reduce the risk of 
infection against the specific attacks.

That's why this plugin is here.

### Features:

This plugin will examine a country code based on the IP address. If a comment, 
pingback or trackback comes from the specific country, it will be blocked 
before Akismet validate it.

With the same mechanism, it will fight against burst access of brute-force 
and reverse-brute-force attacks to the login form and XML-RPC.

* **Immigration control:**  
  Access to the basic and important entrances into the back-end such as 
  `wp-comments-post.php`, `xmlrpc.php`, `wp-login.php`, `wp-admin/admin.php`,
  `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`, `wp-admin/admin-post.php` will be validated by 
  means of a country code based on IP address.

* **Guard against login attempts:**  
  In order to prevent the invasion through the login form and XML-RPC against
  the brute-force and the reverse-brute-force attacks, the number of login 
  attempts will be limited per IP address even from the permitted countries.

* **Zero-day Exploit Prevention:**  
  The original feature "**Z**ero-day **E**xploit **P**revention for WP" (WP-ZEP)
  will block any malicious accesses to `wp-admin/*.php` even from the permitted
  countries. It will protect against certain types of attack such as CSRF, SQLi
  and so on, even if you have some
    [vulnerable plugins](https://wpvulndb.com/ "WPScan Vulnerability Database")
  in your site.
  Because this is an experimental feature, please open an issue at
    [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ip-geo-block "WordPress &#8250; Support &raquo; IP Geo Block")
  if you have any troubles. I'll be profoundly grateful your contribution to
  improve this feature. See more details on
    [this plugin's blog](http://www.ipgeoblock.com/ "Blog of IP Geo Block").

* **Protection of wp-config.php:**  
  A malicious request to try to expose `wp-config.php` via vulnerable plugins 
  or themes can be blocked. A numerous such attacks can be found in 
    [this article](http://www.ipgeoblock.com/article/exposure-of-wp-config-php.html "Prevent exposure of wp-config.php").

* **Support of BuddyPress and bbPress:**  
  You can configure this plugin such that a registered user can login as the
  membership from anywhere, but a request such as a new user registration,
  lost password, creating a new topic, and subscribing comment is blocked by 
  the country code. It is suitable for
    [BuddyPress][BuddyPress]
    and [bbPress][bbPress]
  to help reducing spams.

* **Referrer suppressor for external links:**  
  When you click an external hyperlink on admin screen, http referrer will be 
  eliminated to hide a footprint of your site.

* **Multiple source of IP Geolocation databases:**  
  Free IP Geolocation database and REST APIs are installed into this plugin to
  get a country code from an IP address. There are two types of API which 
  support only IPv4 or both IPv4 and IPv6. This plugin will automatically 
  choose an appropriate API.

* **Database auto updater:**  
  [MaxMind][MaxMind] 
  GeoLite free databases and 
  [IP2Location][IP2Loc] 
  LITE databases can be incorporated with this plugin. Those will be downloaded
  and updated (once a month) automatically.

* **Cache mechanism:**  
  A cache mechanism with transient API for the fetched IP addresses has been 
  equipped to reduce load on the server against the burst accesses with a short
  period of time.

* **Customizing response:**  
  HTTP Response code can be selectable as `403 Forbidden` to deny access pages,
  `404 Not Found` to hide pages or even `200 OK` to redirect to the top page.
  You can also have the custom error page (for example `403.php`) in your theme
  template directory or child theme directory to fit your theme.

* **Validation logs:**  
  Logs will be recorded into MySQL data table to audit posting pattern under 
  the specified condition.

* **Cooperation with full spec security plugin:**  
  This plugin is simple and lite enough to be able to cooperate with other full
  spec security plugin such as 
    [Wordfence Security][wordfence]
  (because the function of country bloking is available only for premium users).

* **Extensibility:**  
  You can customize the basic behavior of this plugin via `add_filter()` with
  pre-defined filter hook. See various use cases in
    [samples.php][samples]
  bundled within this package.

* **Self blocking prevention and easy rescue:**  
  Most of users do not prefer themselves to be blocked. This plugin prevents 
  such thing unless you force it.
    ([release 2.1.4](http://www.ipgeoblock.com/changelog/release-2.1.4.html "2.1.4 Release Note"))
  And futhermore, if such a situation occurs, you can rescue yourself easily.
    ([release 2.1.3](http://www.ipgeoblock.com/changelog/release-2.1.3.html "2.1.3 Release Note"))

* **Clean uninstallation:**  
  Nothing is left in your precious mySQL database after uninstallation. So you
  can feel free to install and activate to make a trial of this plugin's
  functionality. Several days later, you'll find many undesirable accesses in
  your validation logs if all validation targets are enabled.

### Installation:

1. Upload `ip-geo-block` directory to your plugins directory.
2. Activate the plugin on the Plugin dashboard.

#### Validation rule settings

* **Matching rule**  
  Choose either `White list` (recommended) or `Black list` to specify the 
  countries from which you want to pass or block.

* **Country code for matching rule**  
  Specify the country code with two letters (see 
    [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements "ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia")
  ). Each of them should be separated by comma.

* **White/Black list of extra IPs for prior validation**  
  The list of extra IP addresses prior to the validation of country code.
  [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing "Classless Inter-Domain Routing - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia")
  is acceptable to specify the range.

* **$_SERVER keys for extra IPs**  
  Additional IP addresses will be validated if some of keys in `$_SERVER` 
  variable are specified in this textfield. Typically `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR`.

* **Response code**  
  Choose one of the 
    [response code](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-10 "RFC 2616 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1")
  to be sent when it blocks a comment.
  The 2xx code will lead to your top page, the 3xx code will redirect to 
    [Black Hole Server](http://blackhole.webpagetest.org/),
  the 4xx code will lead to WordPress error page, and the 5xx will pretend 
  an server error.

#### Validation target settings

* **Comment post**  
  Validate post to `wp-comment-post.php`. Comment post and trackback will be 
  validated.

### FAQ:

#### I was locked down. What shall I do? ####

Activate the following codes at the bottom of `ip-geo-block.php` and upload it 
via FTP.

```php
/**
 * Invalidate blocking behavior in case yourself is locked out.
 * @note: activate the following code and upload this file via FTP.
 */ /* -- EDIT THIS LINE AND ACTIVATE THE FOLLOWING FUNCTION -- */
function ip_geo_block_emergency( $validate ) {
    $validate['result'] = 'passed';
    return $validate;
}
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-login', 'ip_geo_block_emergency' );
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-admin', 'ip_geo_block_emergency' );
// */
```

Then "**Clear cache**" at "**Statistics**" tab on your dashborad. Remember 
that you should upload the original one to deactivate above feature.

[This release note][Release213]
can also help you.

#### How can I test that this plugin works? ####

The easiest way is to use 
  [free proxy browser addon][ProxyAddon].
Another one is to use 
  [http header browser addon][HttpAddon].
You can add an IP address to the `X-Forwarded-For` header to emulate the 
access behind the proxy. In this case, you should add `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` 
into the "**$_SERVER keys for extra IPs**" on "**Settings**" tab.

#### Are there any filter hooks? ####

Yes, here is the list of all hooks to extend the feature of this plugin.

* `ip-geo-block-api-dir`          : full path to the API class libraries and local DB files.
* `ip-geo-block-backup-dir`       : full path where log files should be saved.
* `ip-geo-block-bypass-admins`    : array of admin queries which should bypass WP-ZEP.
* `ip-geo-block-bypass-plugins`   : array of plugin name which should bypass WP-ZEP.
* `ip-geo-block-bypass-themes`    : array of theme name which should bypass WP-ZEP.
* `ip-geo-block-extra-ips`        : white/black list of extra IPs for prior validation.
* `ip-geo-block-headers`          : compose http request headers.
* `ip-geo-block-ip-addr`          : IP address of accessor.
* `ip-geo-block-ip2location-dir`  : full path where IP2Location LITE DB files should be saved.
* `ip-geo-block-ip2location-path` : full path to IP2Location LITE DB file (IPv4).
* `ip-geo-block-maxmind-dir`      : full path where Maxmind GeoLite DB files should be saved.
* `ip-geo-block-maxmind-zip-ipv4` : url to Maxmind GeoLite DB zip file for IPv4.
* `ip-geo-block-maxmind-zip-ipv6` : url to Maxmind GeoLite DB zip file for IPv6.
* `ip-geo-block-admin`            : validate IP address at `wp-admin/*.php`.
* `ip-geo-block-comment`          : validate IP address at `wp-comments-post.php`.
* `ip-geo-block-login`            : validate IP address at `wp-login.php`.
* `ip-geo-block-xmlrpc`           : validate IP address at `xmlrpc.php`.
* `ip-geo-block-xxxxxx-reason`    : http response reason      for comment|xmlrpc|login|admin.
* `ip-geo-block-xxxxxx-status`    : http response status code for comment|xmlrpc|login|admin.

#### How does WP-ZEP prevent zero-day attack? ####

A considerable number of vulnerable plugins are lacking in validating either 
the nonce and privilege or both. WP-ZEP will make up both of them embedding a 
nonce into the link, form and ajax request from jQuery on every admin screen.

This simple system will validate both of them on behalf of vulnerable plugins 
in your site and will block a request with a query parameter `action` through 
 `wp-admin/(admin|admin-ajax|admin-post).php` if it has no nonce and privilege.
Moreover, it doesn't affects a request from non-logged-in user.

On the other hand, the details of above process are slightly delicate. For 
example, it's incapable of preventing Privilege Escalation (PE) because it 
can't be decided which capabilities does the request need.

See more details on 
[this plugin's blog][MyBlog].

#### How can I use "Block by country" and "WP-ZEP" properly? ####

The basic concept is that the "**Block by country**" is for blocking malicious 
accesses from undesired countries and "**WP-ZEP**" is for blocking from 
permitted contries.

So using both of them is the best.

Speaking about Ajax, the "**Block by country**" will block both front-end and 
back-end services while "**WP-ZEP**" will block only back-end services.

So if you have some plugins providing Ajax services for front-end and prefer 
to serve them for everyone, using only "**WP-ZEP**" for "**Admin ajax/post**" 
may be your choise.

#### Some admin function doesn't work when WP-ZEP is on. ####

There are a few cases that WP-ZEP would not work. One is redirection at server 
side (caused by PHP or `.htaccess`) and client side (by caused JavaScript 
location object or meta tag for refresh).

Another is the case related to the content type. This plugin will only support 
 `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data`.

The other case is that a ajax/post request comes from not jQuery but flash or 
something.

In those cases, this plugin should bypass WP-ZEP. So please find the unique 
strings in the requested queries and add it into the safe query list via the 
filter hook `ip-geo-block-bypass-admins`.

If you can not figure out your troubles, please let me know about the plugin 
you are using at the support forum.
