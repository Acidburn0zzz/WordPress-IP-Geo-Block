### Does this plugin work properly? ###

Absolutely, **YES**.

But unfortunately, accuracy of country code depends on the geolocation 
databases. Actually, there is a case that a same IP address has different 
country code.

![Different country code]({{ '/img/2015-09/ScanCountry.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Different country code"
)

Here is another example:

![Confused country code]({{ '/img/2017-03/ConfusedCountryCode.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Confused country code"
)

In such a case, please consider to select more reliable databases.
