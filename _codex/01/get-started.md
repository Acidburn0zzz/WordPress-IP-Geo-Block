### <span id="1">Be relax at first contact!</span> ###

Just after the installation and activation of [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block], 
you'll see the "Welcome" message and will be prompt to confirm the 
"**Matching rule**" at "**Validation rule settings**".

But it's better to keep yourself in a relaxed state for a several seconds, 
becase a background process of downloading Geo-IP databases may be running.

### <span id="2">Still see the "Welcome" message?</span> ###

When you still see the "Welcome" message on the IP Geo Block dashboard, please 
select either "**white list**" or "**black list**" at "**Matching rule**" and 
put a proper country code into the "**Country code for matching rule**".

### <span id="3">In case of the "Lock out" warning</span> ###

Even if you save a wrong count code, you'll never be locked out while you are 
logged in as an administrator.

Please click the "**Scan your country code**" button to find your proper 
country code.
