In the last release 2.1.4, I announced [the new feature to prevent self 
blocking][release214]. But this was not enough at the first installation.
Every user hates a product which suddenly shuts him/herself out right after 
the first installation. This was the reason why I got one <span class="emoji">

</span> at the [Reviews][BeCareful].

### <span id="sec1">Preventing self blocking at the first installation</span> ###

The solution is simple. You're never blocked out while you're logged in but 
just get an admin notice.

![Different country code]({{ "/img/2015-09/BlockingNotice.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Different country code"
)

Actually, [the issue][BeCareful] was not a bug but the matter of design.
For the user's convenience, this plugin will automatically set the proper 
country code into the white list when the user install it for the fist time.

In the previous release, when this plugin could not get the proper country 
code for some reasons from MaxMind database which was automatically installed 
on your server, it would try to use other Free Geolocation APIs until it got 
the proper one at the first installation. But sometimes this mechanism will 
cause an issue when those APIs tell the different country codes on the same IP 
address.

Nils gave me [a nice suggestion][nice-idea]:

> too?

Yeah, that's a splendid idea !!

![Different country code]({{ "/img/2015-09/ScanCountry.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Different country code"
)

Yet even with this new feature, I can't decide if this plugin should put all 
the country codes into the list automatically, because there's a possibility 
that those codes would be undesired.

And futher more, if the ISP provides us a dynamic IP address, another 
possibility will come to block out ourselves with this initial setting.

![Dynamic IP address]({{ "/img/2015-09/DynamicIP.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Dynamic IP address"
)

So I decided to leave it to the user's selection, but just prompt the notice at
the first installation to confirm settings. I believe this design is the most 
balanced between convenient and inconvenient.

### <span id="sec2">Pie chart for "Blocked by countries"</span> ###

This is a substitution of a dull list for "**Blocked by countries**" using 
[Google Chart library][GoogleChart]. Although it's so not useful, I think it's 
better than to display poor list.

![Blocked by countries]({{ "/img/2015-09/PieChart.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Blocked by countries"
)

### <span id="sec3">Strengthen WP-ZEP against CSRF</span> ###

WP-ZEP has an ability to prevent [CSRF][CSRF-OWASP] by verifying a special 
embeded token (called ["nonce"][WP-Nonces] which is [one of the CSRF 
prevention methods][SyncToken]) in the requests to the admin area, plugin 
area and theme area.

Suppose that you have a plugin or a theme which has vulnerability against the 
CSRF. If an attacker submitted a malicious link (which action is targetted to 
that vulnerability) into your site, and you accidentally click it, then you 
would excute undesired action. I call it "OSRF" - Own Site Request Forgeries.
(Usually the attakers may use shortened URL. This is exactly CSRF !!)

Fortunately, WordPress comment system adds `rel="nofollow"` to the links which 
are submitted into the comments. Now in this release, WP-ZEP will stop to embed
a nonce into the links which have `rel="nofollow"` in order to prevent OSRF.

#### Note: ####

If you submit a following sensitive link into your WordPress comment and click 
it, you'll get "0" with status `200 OK`. (Replace "example.com" to your home.)

> http://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=delete-post&id=1

Of course it won't work. But basically the request reaches the WordPress core.
Suppose that the above request was only for the admin and reached vulnerable 
plugin, the post id 1 would be deleted while you're logged in as an admin.

Even though in this case, WP-ZEP for `Admin ajax/post` will refuse that request
with the status `403 Forbidden`. (It depends on your settings.)

### <span id="sec4">Bug fix: Illegal handling of fragment in URL</span> ###

If you enables "**Prevent zero-day exploit**" for "**Admin area**", you would 
encounter the "**Forbidden**" message with a click at a certain link. It was 
caused by inappropriate handling for the [Fragment identifier][Fragment] in URL.

![URL with Fragment]({{ "/img/2015-09/URLwithFragment.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "URL with Fragment"
)

Now this issue has been fixed.
