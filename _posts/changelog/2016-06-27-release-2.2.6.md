<!--more-->

### Bug fix: Exceptions ###

In [2.2.5][Release225], I equiped "**Exceptions**" for Plugins/Themes area 
which can specify the plugins/themes to bypass the validation of "**Block 
by country**" and "**Prevent Zero-day Exploit**" without using filter hooks 
[`ip-geo-block-bypass-plugins`][BypassPlugins] and 
[`ip-geo-block-bypass-themes`][BypassThemes].

![Exceptions for Plugins/Themes area]({{ '/img/2016-06/Exceptions.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Exceptions for Plugins/Themes area"
)

This feature is for the user who wants to provide the services of plugins / 
themes to every visitors just in case this plugin blocks them. But because of 
inconsistency of internal data, this feature didn't work as expected.

Now it works!

### Export log file ###

This plugin provide you [`ip-geo-block-backup-dir`][BackupDir] filter hook to 
export the logs into the specific directory by CSV format. From this release, 
you can download CSV file on the "**Logs**" tab to analyze the attacks.

![Export CSV log file]({{ '/img/2016-06/ExportCSV.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Export CSV log file"
)

Each column in CSV is defined as follow:

| Column        | Sample                                     |
|:--------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| Date/Time     | 2016-06-19 14:28:02                        |
| IP address    | 182.22.72.251                              |
| Country code  | JP                                         |
| Target        | admin                                      |
| Result        | wp-zep                                     |
| Requested URI | POST[80]:/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php          |
| User agent    | Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1;)  |
| HTTP headers  | HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR=182.22.72.251         |
| $_POST data   | action=revslider_ajax_action,client_action |

### A new filter hook ###

I think there're some users who want to control the conditions of recording 
logs in more detail. For example, not "**Only when blocked**" but also 
"**Unauthenticated users**" to analyze what's going on in your backend.

![Record settings]({{ '/img/2016-06/RecordSettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Record settings"
)

In this case, a new filter hook [`ip-geo-block-record-logs`][RecordLogs] can 
help you. You can put the following snippet into your theme's `functions.php`.

{% highlight ruby startinline %}
/**
 * Example : Usage of 'ip-geo-block-record-logs'
 * Use case: Record logs additionally when an unauthenticated user passes.
 *
 * @param  int    $record   0:none 1:blocked 2:passed 3:unauth 4:auth 5:all
 * @param  string $hook     'comment', 'xmlrpc', 'login' or 'admin'
 * @param  array  $validate the result of validation which contains:
 *  'ip'       => string    ip address
 *  'auth'     => int       authenticated (>= 1) or not (0)
 *  'code'     => string    country code
 *  'time'     => unsinged  processing time for examining the country code
 *  'provider' => string    IP geolocation service provider
 *  'result'   => string    'passed' or the reason of blocking
 * @return int    $record   modified condition
 */
function my_record_logs( $record, $hook, $validate ) {
    /* when an unauthenticated user passes */
    if ( ! $validate['auth'] && 'passed' === $validate['result'] )
        $record = 3; /* Unauthenticated users */

    return $record;
}
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-record-logs', 'my_record_logs', 10, 3 );
{% endhighlight %}
