When I go abroad, I want to manage my WordPress site as an administrator from 
there. To realize this, I've implemented a new feature which was proposed at 
the [support forum][Asking-extending]. (Thanks, [digiblogger][digiblogger]
!!)

<!--more-->

### A new feature for login ###

A new choice `Block by country (register, lost password)` has been equipped at 
"**Login form**" on "**Settings**" tab. This feature allows you to "**login**" 
and "**logout**" from anywhere, but any other request to login form will be 
validated by the country code.

![Block by country (register, lost password)]({{ '/img/2015-06/validation-settings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Block by country (register, lost password)")

It's suitable for "**Membership: Anyone can register**" on 
"[Settings General Screen][general-settings]". Also for [BuddPress][BuddyPress] 
and [bbPress][bbPress].

One thing you should know about this feature is that it changes the priority of 
validation rules. Basically, this plugin has 3 rules, i.e. **WP-ZEP**, 
**country code** and **authentication**. In the previous version, the priority 
of those are as follows ("BBC" means "Block by country"):

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Login form</th>
        <th>1st priority</th>
        <th>2nd priority</th>
        <th>3rd priofity</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>BBC</code></td>
        <td>WP-ZEP</td>
        <td>country code</td>
        <td>authentication</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

In this version:

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Login form</th>
        <th>1st priority</th>
        <th>2nd priority</th>
        <th>3rd priofity</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><code>BBC</code></td>
        <td>WP-ZEP</td>
        <td>country code</td>
        <td>authentication</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>BBC (...)</code></td>
        <td>WP-ZEP</td>
        <td>authentication</td>
        <td>country code</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

The reason why the `BBC (...)` has different priority from `BBC` is that I would 
not like to change the priority of the previous version. So you have nothing to 
do if you would not use this feature.

If you choose it and want to add more permitted countries for login, you can 
embed the following codes into your `functions.php`:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
function my_whitelist( $validate ) {
    $whitelist = array(
        'JP', 'US', // should be upper case
    );

    $validate['result'] = 'blocked';

    if ( in_array( $validate['code'], $whitelist ) )
        $validate['result'] = 'passed';

    return $validate;
}
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-login', 'my_whitelist' );
?>
{% endhighlight %}

### A new feature for bbPress ###

If you choose `Block by country` at "**Comment post**" on "**Settings**" tab, 
a user can't post data to create a new topic and reply (where the http response 
is "403 Forbidden" by default) unless he/she is logged in.

With the combination of the previous feature, this can help to reduce spams.

![bbPress forum]({{ '/img/2015-06/bbPress-forum.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "bbPress forum")

To test this feature, add the following codes into your `functions.php` 
(of course on your test site <span class="emoji">
![emoji](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png)
</span>).


{% highlight php %}
<?php
function my_replace_ip( $ip ) {
    return '98.139.183.24'; // yahoo.com
}
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-ip-addr', 'my_replace_ip' );
?>
{% endhighlight %}

A drawback of this feature is that the convenient behavior of bbPress will be 
disabled. When you log out and log in again, bbPress takes you to the page 
where you were. As this could be potentially block you, this plugin behaves 
same as BuddyPress when your log out.

### A new feature for an error page ###

For example, the `403.php` in the theme template directory or child theme 
directory is used (if it exists) when this plugin blocks specific requests.

![403 page]({{ '/img/2015-06/403-page.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "403 page")

And also some new filter hooks are available to customize the http response 
status code and reason message:

* `ip-geo-block-comment-status`, `ip-geo-block-comment-reason`
* `ip-geo-block-xmlrpc-status`, `ip-geo-block-xmlrpc-reason`
* `ip-geo-block-login-status`, `ip-geo-block-login-reason`
* `ip-geo-block-admin-status`, `ip-geo-block-admin-reason`

Use those hooks as follows:

{% highlight php %}
<?php
function my_login_status( $code ) {
    return 503;
}
function my_login_reason( $msg ) {
    return "Sorry, this service is unavailable.";
}
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-login-status', 'my_login_status' );
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-login-reason', 'my_login_reason' );
?>
{% endhighlight %}

### Obsoleted filter hooks ###

With some improvement of internal logic, 
`ip-geo-block-(admin-actions|admin-pages|wp-content)` were obsoluted.
Alternatively new filter hooks `ip-geo-block-bypass-(admins|plugins|themes)` 
are added to bypass WP-ZEP.

As long as there is no trouble with WP-ZIP, this feature would not be necessary.
But if you need, please check out [samples.php][samples.php] about the usage of 
these hooks.

### Capturing malicious access to the plugins/themes ###

Some silly attackers (or tools) send invalid requests to the plugins/themes 
area whose path are like this:

![silly access]({{ '/img/2015-06/invalid-plugins.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "silly access")

This kind of access seems to be aimed at the contaminated sites. Normally it 
fails in "404 Not Found" and don't matter even when we leave them alone.
However, I think it's a good chance to know the malicious post pattern if this 
plugin records such a footprint. So I made the condition of capturing a 
malicious access to the plugins or themes area in a loose manner.

Although it's a little annoying, please be patient and enjyo this release !!
