In this release, some new features and improvements have been implemented.
These are based on the feedbacks I got at the [support forum][forum] from 
my users.

<!--more-->

### Emergency function ###

This feature inhibits the blocking behavior of this plugin when you are locked 
out by misfortune.

Open the `ip-geo-block.php` using [appropriate editor][editors] and activate 
the code block in "**Emergent Functionality**" section near the bottom of the 
file as follows:

![Emergency function]({{ '/img/2015-08/EmergencyFunction.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Emergency function"
)

Replacing `/*` (opening multi-line comment) to `//` (single line comment) is 
also good. And save it then upload it to this plugin's directory on your server 
via FTP.

The accuracy of the country code depends on the geolocation database. Sometimes 
this trouble may be caused by a mismatch between the country code derived from 
IP address and the rule of "**Validation rule settings**" on "**Settings**" tab.

After reconfiguring those settings properly, do not forget to restore the 
`ip-geo-block.php` on your server to the original.

### A rescue process at emergency ###

I strongly recommend the above mentioned features at your emergency. However, 
all users are not familiar with editing PHP file. So I implemented another 
path to remove, reinstall and reactivate this plugin.

When you just remove `ip-geo-block` in your plugin's directory forcibly by 
using FTP or something, you'll see the following message on your plugin's 
dashboard.

![Force to delete]({{ '/img/2015-08/ForceDelete.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Force to delete"
)

After that, you can reinstall and reactivate it. But you'll find soon you're 
blocked again because your settings still remains in the mySQL database.
Well then..., after pausing for breath, you can visit your admin dashboard 
again!!

At the reactivation process, a rescue process will be kicked off as a cron job 
by who has rigth permission for managing options in order to overwrite your 
settings in the mySQL database. Therefore after you revive as an admin, you 
should reconfirm your settings of this plugin.

### New feature on Settings tab ###

Now you can click a section title on "**Settings**" tab to flip each settings 
open and close. And also you can check your IP and country code at 
"**Validation rule settings**".

![New settings tab]({{ '/img/2015-08/NewSettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "New settings tab"
)

### Removing unneeded query string ###

In the previous version, a query string containing nonce was attached to 
resources under the `wp-content/(plugins|themes)/` when you are logged-in as 
an admin. This is necessary for [WP-ZEP][WP-ZEP] but bad for the site 
performance if it attached to the "static" resources. So I just restrict it 
to the PHP files.

### Living with Autoptimize ###

[Autoptimize][AO] speeds up your site by aggregating and minimizing JS, CSS and 
HTML. In general, this functionality has some delicate processes. For example, 
a JS file whose name has a word "nonce" will be excluded from Autoptimize cache 
because a nonce should be "dynamic" and not be kept in its cache.

This caused [an issue][AO-issue] that some links into the `wp-admin/` were 
blocked by [WP-ZEP][WP-ZEP].

Although I wonder a JS file could be "dynamic", everything goes fine after 
changing the name of JS file from `auth-nonce.js` to `authenticate.js`.

### Conclusion ###

Your feedbacks always give me chances to improved this plugin. So please do not 
hesitate posting your annoyances at the [support forum][forum] <span class="emoji">
