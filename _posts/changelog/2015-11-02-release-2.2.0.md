I'm very pleased to announce the release of [IP Geo Block 2.2.0][IP-Geo-Block].
In this release, 2 new features are implemented to enhance its the protection 
ability against the malicious accesses.

The estimated amount of true positive against preventing malicous accesses in 
the real world would be about 80% now.

### <span id="sec1">New feature: Extra IPs for white/black list</span> ###

While it blocks (or accepts) accesses from forbidden (or permitted) countries, 
extra IP addresses can be bypassed (or blocked) prior to the validation of 
country code.

You can put the extra IP addresses of both IPv4 and IPv6 with [CIDR notation]
[CIDR] into the **Validation rule settings**.

![Extra IPs]({{ "/img/2015-11/extra-ips.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Extra IPs"
)

You can also register your own filter hook via `ip-geo-block-extra-ips` to add 
more IPs programmatically. The following is a sample code in `functions.php` 
to retrieve IPs from [TOR][TOR] node listing services like [this][PIKE].

{% highlight php %}
<?php
define( 'MY_EXTRA_IPS_LIST', 'my_extra_ips_list' );
define( 'MY_EXTRA_IPS_CRON', 'my_extra_ips_cron' );
function my_extra_ips_get() {
    $list = json_decode(
        @file_get_contents( 'http://pike.hqpeak.com/api/free.php' ),
        TRUE // convert object to array
    );

    //  keep the list in the cache (matching 0.2msec)
    if ( is_array( $list ) ) {
        $list = implode( ',', $list );
        set_transient( MY_EXTRA_IPS_LIST, $list, DAY_IN_SECONDS );
    }

    if ( ! wp_next_scheduled( MY_EXTRA_IPS_CRON ) )
        wp_schedule_single_event( time() + HOUR_IN_SECONDS, MY_EXTRA_IPS_CRON );

    return $list;
}
function my_extra_ips_hook( $extra_ips, $hook ) {
    // restrict the target hook
    if ( in_array( $hook, array( 'xmlrpc', 'login' ) ) ) {
        $list = get_transient( MY_EXTRA_IPS_LIST );

        // if the list does not exist, then update
        if ( ! $list )
            $list = my_extra_ips_get();

        $extra_ips['black_list'] .= ( $extra_ips['black_list'] ? ',' : '' ) . $list;
    }

    return $extra_ips;
}
add_action( MY_EXTRA_IPS_CRON, 'my_extra_ips_get' );
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-extra-ips', 'my_extra_ips_hook', 10, 2 );
?>
{% endhighlight %}

#### <span id="sec1.1">Remarks in Validation Logs</span> ####

Now validation results are logged in detail.

![Validation logs]({{ "/img/2015-11/validation-logs.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Validation logs"
)

### <span id="sec2">New feature: Evolution of validation target settings</span> ###

Validation target of "**Block by country**" and "**Prevent Zero-day Exploit**" 
are more conspicuous than before for "**Admin area**" and "**Admin ajax/post**".

- **Block by country**  
  It will block the requests related to the backend services for both public 
  facing page and dashboard.

- **Prevent Zero-day Exploit**  
  Regardless of the country code, it will block the malicious requests related 
  to the backend services only for dashboard.

Applying both is the most effective because it can protect any malicous access 
to the dashboard while providing any services such as ajax to users from the 
permitted countries. On the other hand, enabling only wp-zep is still useful 
because everybody can receive the services on the public facing pages.

![Validation target settings]({{ "/img/2015-11/target-settings.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Validation target settings"
)

And new target "**Important files**" is added to prevent exposing 
`wp-config.php` and `/etc/passwd`.

### <span id="sec3">Privacy considerations about IP address</span> ###

An IP addresses can be considered as a personal data when it is combined with 
other information such as country or any other environment variables.

With regard to European data protection law, [this question][P-000873/2013] 
and [ansewer][A-000873/2013] tells the important principle :

> Any processing of client data such as IP addresses must be in line with 
> the national laws implementing the requirements of Directive 95/46/EC; ... 
> personal data must be processed on legitimate grounds, for a specific 
> purpose and must be proportionate to the aim pursued. The clients ... must 
> be informed about the processing.

So I added some notices at **Geolocation API settings** and **Anonymize IP 
address** at **Record settings**. Current anonymizing will mask the last three 
digits of IP address when it is recorded into the log. But this is not enough.
Just better than none at all.

![Record settings]({{ "/img/2015-11/record-settings.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Record settings"
)

### <span id="sec4">Bug fix: Text message on comment form</span> ###

You may state your own privacy policy at comment form. But in the previous 
versions, all spaces were deleted in the **Text message on comment form**.

Now this issue is fixed and you can also use some tags same as comment form.

![Submission settings]({{ "/img/2015-11/submission-settings.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Submission settings"
)

### <span id="sec5">Protection Performance</span> ###

In the past, I analyzed the attack vectors against the WordPress plugins 
[in this article][ATACKVEC] and now [have updated][ANALYSIS] for this release.

The estimated best result is as follows <span class="emoji">
![emoji](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/metal.png)
</span> :

| Blocking Method  | True Positive  | False Negative |
|:-----------------|---------------:|---------------:|
| Block by country |    41/50 (82%) |     9/50 (18%) |
| WP-ZEP           |    38/50 (76%) |    12/50 (24%) |
