[RFC1939][RFC1939] defines an **autonomous system** as follows:

> Autonomous system is a connected group of one or more IP addresses run by 
> one or more network operators which has a SINGLE and CLEARLY DEFINED routing 
> policy.

And [autonomous system number (ASN)][ASN] is a registered entity supported by 
such as Internet Service Providers (ISP) or other large organizations that 
control blocks of IP addresses.

So we can make use of it to control permissions against the requests instead 
of using a long list of IP addresses or a ranage of them by [CIDR][CIDR].

<!--more-->

### New feature: Use AS number ###

On the "**Settings**" tab, You can find a new option "**Use Autonomous System 
Number (ASN)**" in "**Validation rule settings**" section. After enabling it, 
you can specify the AS numbers in the "**Whitelist**" or "**Blacklist**" of 
"**extra IP addresses prior to country code**" as follows:

![AS number]({{ '/img/2017-08/ASNumber.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "AS number"
)

Note that usually [ISP][ISP], [SNS][SNS] and [web search engine][WSE] provide 
many services through different network groups. For example, [yahoo has 
registered many AS numbers][Yahoo]. So does [Google][Google]. As for 
[Automattic][Automattic], [Jetpack][Jetpack] is run as a service on [multiple 
AS numbers][JetpackASN] which include other range of IP addresses than Jetpack 
needs.

Therefore we should notice that an AS number doesn't always identify the 
specific organization nor the services. It’s originally aimed for routing 
[IPs][IPS] to intervene information between different network groups.

On the other hand, [this plugin][IP-Geo-Block] also provides "[**UA string and 
Qualification**][UAQ]". For example, Google has many network groups registered 
as AS15169 which can be put into the "**Whitelist of extra IP addresses prior 
to country code**" to accept their bots. Instead of doing this, we can also 
put `Google:HOST` into "**UA string and Qualification**" as their host name 
can be looked up by its IP address.

![UA string and qualification]({{ '/img/2016-08/UA-Qualify.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "UA string and qualification"
)

So, we need find some good practices to utilize those functionalities.

I would appreciate you if you share what you find <span class="emoji">

</span>.

#### Server resource usage ####

This functionality needs additional seeking to dedicated databases. You can 
check its seek time at "**Search tab**" when you search an IP address.

![Seek time]({{ '/img/2017-08/SeekTime.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Seek time"
)

A seeked result would be kept in the cache of IP addresses. So I think it 
would not be so serious to the site performance. But if you don't like it, 
please turn "**Enable**" off at "**Use Autonomous System Number**".

As for size of DBs, its total size for IPv4 and IPv6 would be nearly 10M bytes.

![DBs for AS number]({{ '/img/2017-08/ASN-DBs.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "DBs for AS number"
)

#### Deleting databases ####

I'm afraid to say that I didn't provide you any UI to delete those DBs.

If you do not need those DBs, please delete them directly in "[**Geolocation 
API library**][GeoAPILib]" folder using FTP or some kind of file manager like 
cPanel. Then make "**Use Autonomous System Number**" disabled and perform 
"**Save Changes**".

### New feature: Statistics in logs ###

You might be interested in "[WordPress Attack Report][AttackRepo]" at WordFence
blog. Just like this report, you can know what kind of attacks you had in your 
site.

![Statistics in logs]({{ '/img/2017-08/StatisticsLogs.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Statistics in logs"
)

Clicking the links would naviate you to the details on **Logs** tab.

![Statistics in Admin area]({{ '/img/2017-08/LogsAdminArea.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Statistics in Admin area"
)

I know I should provide a real time reporting feature in the future. For now, 
please be patient with this!

### Improvement: Capabilities to be verified ###

This plugin had equipped the protection functionality against **Arbitrary File 
Upload** (AFU) since [release 3.0.3][Release303]. From this release, you can 
manage to verify the capability which may be required by a paticular uploader 
such as [Awesome Support plugin][AwesomeSup].

![Prevent malicious file uploading]({{ '/img/2017-08/PreventAFU.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Prevent malicious file uploading"
)

And also add a new filter hook [`ip-geo-block-upload-capability`][UploadCap] to
replace or add the capability to be verified.

### Improvement: Compatibility with WP-ZEP ###

[Zero-day Exploit Prevention][WP-ZEP] is one of the strong suit of this plugin.
It embeds a special crafted [nonce][NONCE] into pages to be protected, and thus 
effectively blocks malicious access from outside of dashboard.

But based on its mechanism, it is likely to prone to issues. So in this release,
I made two improvements.

#### Inhibit embedding a nonce ####

Until the previous version, a nonce was embeded into every links independently 
of the settings for WP-ZEP. From this release, you can manage to inhibit those 
embedding when WP-ZEP is disabled at each target.

For example, when you disable "**Prevent Zero-day Exploit**" at "**Admin 
ajax/post**", then no nonce would be embeded into ajax requests.

![WP-ZEP for Admin area]({{ '/img/2017-08/Admin-WP-ZEP.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "WP-ZEP for Admin area"
)

#### Candidate actions for exceptions ####

On your public facing pages, you might want to provide all the services using 
ajax to each visitor. In this case, you can select "**Exceptions**" at "**Admin
ajax/post**".

![WP-ZEP for Admin ajax/post]({{ '/img/2017-08/ExceptionsAjax.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "WP-ZEP for Admin ajax/post"
)

In the previous release, all the actions could not be listed. This issue is 
fixed in this release. And furthermore, the "unlock icon"
(<span class="emoji">
![Unlock icon]({{ '/img/2017-08/unlock.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
</span>) filters actions for non logged-in user on your site so that you can 
easily pick them up.

![Filter for non logged-in user]({{ '/img/2017-08/ExceptionsFilter.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Filter for non logged-in user"
)

Using these UI, you can easily configure this plugin to block malicious 
requests against the administrator functions for logged-in users, while 
you can provide ajax services to all the visitors even from your country.

If you find any issues what I should fix, please let me know at [support 
forum][IPGB-Forum] <span class="emoji">
