In the early version of this plugin, "**Search**" tab had been a kind of 
debugging tool for me to test accessing geolocation database and APIs.
On the other hand, it was not so uesful for users.

Now in this release, it becomes to be able to lookup reverse DNS data and 
whois database. Those functionalities has been developed for [release 3.0.0]
[CallFor300]. But I decided to apply it to this release.

I believe it can help you to gain deep insight about the IP address of 
malicous access.
