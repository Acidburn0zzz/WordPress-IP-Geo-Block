On release 3.0.7, this plugin had been equipped with [WordPress-IP-Geo-API]
[IP-Geo-API] for [GeoLite2 free databases][GeoLite2] becase Maxmind announced 
that [GeoLite Legacy Downloadable Databases][GeoliteLegacy] will be stopped 
updating on April 1, 2018.

But the new databases seemed not to have enough entries compared to the legacy 
one. And also 3.0.7 had an serious bug which made descendent scanning stopped 
when the API claimed that a country code was unknown, i.e. `ZZ`.

After releasing 3.0.8 to fix the above issue on , I have observed how many 
times GeoLite2 databases claimed `ZZ`. It still occurred but I decided to 
change the priority of scanning order because the day will come on next month.

### Maintenance: Priority of scanning order ###

Now you can find "**Geolite2**" is placed higher than "**Maxmind**" which 
handles GeoLite Legacy DBs in "**Geolocation API settings**" section. It means 
GeoLite2 DBs would be always scanned before GeoLite Legacy's.

![Geolocation API settings]({{ '/img/2018-03/GeolocationAPISettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Geolocation API settings"
)

When GeoLite2 DB fails to scan a country code (i.e. `ZZ`), then Legacy DB is 
used to determine the country code. The following picture shows that Legacy DBs
are used 8 times as fallbacks for the recent month.

![Statistics of validation]({{ '/img/2018-03/StatisticsValidation.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Statistics of validation"
)

The problem here is that those fallbacks take additional costs (e.g. time and 
server resource). So if you find these so frequently, please uncheck 
"**Geolite2**" in "**Geolocation API settings**" section.

### New featuer: CIDR calculator ###

You can find the [SOS button][DashIcon-SOS] beside the text area for IP address 
and AS Number.

![Help button]({{ '/img/2018-03/HelpButton.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Help button"
)

It pops up a CIDR calculator that is actually to convert some range of IP 
addresses and [CIDR][CIDR] to each other.

![CIDR calculator for IPv4/IPv6]({{ '/img/2018-03/CIDR-Calculator.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "CIDR calculator for IPv4/IPv6"
)

It's a full JavaScript program that I transplanted from the following PHP 
libraries.

- [S1lentium/IPTools](https://github.com/S1lentium/IPTools)
- [kvz/locutus](https://github.com/kvz/locutus)
- [MikeMcl/big.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js/)

Here, I'll show you some examples to explain how it works to convert to each 
other.

#### Example 1 ####

If you put the following range of IP addresses into the "**Range**" text area 
and click "**&rarr;**" :

{% highlight ruby %}
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255
{% endhighlight %}

you'll get the answer in the "**CIDR**" text area like this :

{% highlight ruby %}
192.168.0.0/16
{% endhighlight %}

#### Example 2 ####

If you put the following 2 lines as "**CIDR**" and click "**&larr;**" :

{% highlight ruby %}
192.168.0.0/16
192.168.0.0/32
{% endhighlight %}

you will get `192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255` as "**Range**" because 
`192.168.0.0/16` includes `192.168.0.0/32`.

#### Example 3 ####

If you put the following 2 lines as "**Range**" :

{% highlight ruby %}
192.168.2.0 - 192.168.2.255
192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255
{% endhighlight %}

you will get the answer :

{% highlight ruby %}
192.168.1.0/24
192.168.2.0/24
{% endhighlight %}

Then click "**&larr;**" to convert them back to "**Range**" again, you'll get 
1 line as follows :

{% highlight ruby %}
192.168.1.0 - 192.168.2.255
{% endhighlight %}

#### Example 4 ####

If you put `192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254` into "**Range**", you will get the 
answer like this :

{% highlight ruby %}
192.168.1.1/32
192.168.1.2/31
192.168.1.4/30
192.168.1.8/29
192.168.1.16/28
192.168.1.32/27
192.168.1.64/26
192.168.1.128/26
192.168.1.192/27
192.168.1.224/28
192.168.1.240/29
192.168.1.248/30
192.168.1.252/31
192.168.1.254/32
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, you should specify `192.168.1.0/16` as "**CIDR**" because it 
covers all the above IP addresses.
