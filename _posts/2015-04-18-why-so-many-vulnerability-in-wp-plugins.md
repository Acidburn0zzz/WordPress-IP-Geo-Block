The above graph shows recent statistics of WordPress vulnerability from 
[WPScan Vulnerability Database][WPScan] analyzed by [Sucuri][Sucuri] which 
is a world wide security company especially famous for analyzing WordPress 
vulnerability.

Why so many vulnerabilities are there in WP plugins?

After reading the [Sucuri Blog][Sucuri-Blog] deeply and widely, I came to 
the conclusion that there are some kind of disuse and misuse of WordPress 
core functions.

### XSS ###

Unfortunately, <abbr title="cross site scripting">XSS</abbr> is very popular 
in WordPress plugins. In many cases, this occur with insufficient validation 
of untrusted data which comes from the outside (including from the DB) and 
lack of an escape just before responding to the user agent. The later is a 
fundamental countermeasure.

I make corresponding table between "[XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet][OWASP-XSS]" 
in OWASP and "[Data Validation][Data-Validation]" in Codex.

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Context</th>
        <th>Code Sample</th>
        <th>Defense</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>HTML body</td>
        <td><samp>&lt;div&gt;<code>DATA</code>&lt;/div&gt;</samp></td>
        <td><code>esc_html()</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>HTML attributes</td>
        <td><samp>&lt;input&hellip;value="<code>DATA</code>"&gt;</samp></td>
        <td><code>esc_attr()</code>, <code>sanitize_text_field()</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>GET parameter</td>
        <td><samp>&lt;a href="&hellip;?value=<code>DATA</code>"&gt;&hellip;&lt;/a&gt;</samp></td>
        <td><code>esc_url()</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>SRC/HREF attribute</td>
        <td><samp>&lt;iframe src="<code>DATA</code>" /&gt;</samp></td>
        <td><code>esc_url()</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>JavaScript Variable</td>
        <td><samp>&lt;script&gt;foo('<code>DATA</code>');&lt;/script&gt;</samp></td>
        <td><code>esc_js()</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>CSS Value</td>
        <td><samp>&lt;div style="width:<code>DATA</code>;"&gt;&hellip;&lt;/div&gt;</samp></td>
        <td>N/A</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

You already know this very well? Good!

When it comes to [Blubrry PowerPress <= 6.0][XSS-PowerPress], it had already 
taken considerations against XSS. The following statistics shows before and 
after fixing XSS.

<div class="table-responsive text-center">
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>&nbsp;</th>
        <th>Files</th>
        <th>Lines</th>
        <th><code>htmlspecialchars()</code></th>
        <th><code>esc_html()</code></th>
        <th><code>esc_attr()</code></th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>before</td>
        <td>42</td>
        <td>36280</td>
        <td>274</td>
        <td>82</td>
        <td>153</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>after</td>
        <td>33</td>
        <td>22807</td>
        <td>160</td>
        <td>53</td>
        <td>131</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

In fact, those paches could be seen every where in their codes. It was hard to 
track before and after. Additionally, there were `htmlspecialchars()` and 
`esc_html()` mixed up.

Speaking about `esc_html()`, the third parameter to `htmlspecialchars()` is 
specified more strictly than their codes. I could hardly say that's OK or not, 
but using core functions is always OK.

Also it's important to design codes to separate "Validating Input" in "Model" 
and "Escaping Output" in "View". I'm not saying about MVC Here. But codex says 
to use 
"[Validating Sanitizing and Escaping User Data][Sanitizing-Escaping]" 
along the context. So I think that we should design the context at first.

### SQL Injection ###

On August 2014, Sucuri reported about 
[SQLi in Custom Contact Forms][Custom-Contact-Forms].

Here is the POC. It dumps the SQL queries and download previous ones.

{% highlight php startinline=true %}
if (!is_admin()) { /* is front */
    ...
    $custom_contact_front = new CustomContactFormsFront();
    ...
} else { /* is admin */
    ...
    $custom_contact_admin = new CustomContactFormsAdmin();
    ...
    add_action('init', array(&$custom_contact_admin, 'adminInit'), 1);
}
 
function adminInit() {
    $this->downloadExportFile();
    $this->downloadCSVExportFile();
    $this->runImport();
}
{% endhighlight %}

The function `adminInit` is no doubt for administrators, but the codes had 
at least next five issues.

1. Validate user role by `is_admin()`.
2. Lack of consideration of unexpected access route.
3. Export and import without validating user privilege.
4. Export raw SQL to the client.
5. Import raw SQL from the client.

As a result, an attacker can easyly know the DB prefix set in the 
`wp-config.php` and upload some malicious SQL to exploit the site.

[![Vulnerability of Custom Contact Form]({{ "/img/2015-04/custom-contact-form.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
  "Vulnerability of Custom Contact Form"
)][Custom-Contact-Forms]

This is caused by misuse of `is_admin()` which is always `true` when someone 
access the admin area even without authentication.

To avoid this vulnerability, the developer must follow the 
[SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet][OWASP-SQL] like below:

1. Validate user privilege by `current_user_can()` with `manage_options`.
2. Validate nonece to limit the access route.
3. Export and import validated and parameterized queries.
4. Use stored procedures.
5. Escape all user supplied input.

The action hook `admin_init` may cause similar misuse. Sucuri reported 
[RFI in MailPoet Plugin](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/07/remote-file-upload-vulnerability-on-mailpoet-wysija-newsletters.html "WordPress Security Vuln in MailPoet Plugin | Sucuri Blog")
on July 1 2014, and
[RCE in Platform theme](https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/01/security-advisory-vulnerabilities-in-pagelinesplatform-theme-for-wordpress.html "Security Advisory - Vulnerabilities in Pagelines/Platform theme for WordPress - Public Preview | Sucuri Blog")
on Jan 21 2015.

### Privilege Escalation ###

On February 3 2015, Sucuri disclosed 
[PE in UpdraftPlus plugin](https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/02/advisory-dangerous-nonce-leak-in-updraftplus.html "Advisory - Dangerous &quot;nonce&quot; leak in UpdraftPlus | Sucuri Blog").

Suppose a registered user hit a button on the dashboard to do something.

{% highlight php startinline=true %}
<form method="post" action="<?php echo admin_url( 'admin.php' ); ?>">
    <?php wp_nonce_field( 'foo-secret-nonce' ); ?>
    <input type="hidden" name="action" value="foo" />
    <input type="submit" value="Something to do" />
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

When `wp-admin/?action=foo` is requested, the function `foo_handler` will be 
triggered via action hook `admin_action_foo` by following code:

{% highlight php startinline=true %}
add_action( 'admin_action_foo', 'foo_handler' );
{% endhighlight %}

If the `foo-secret-nonce` is also used for an administrator function to do an 
important job and only `check_admin_referer('foo-secret-nonce')` is examined 
without validating user privilege, a PE will happen.

Exactly the same vulnerability in WPtouch was also 
[disclosed on July 14, 2014](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/07/disclosure-insecure-nonce-generation-in-wptouch.html "Disclosure: Insecure Nonce Generation in WPtouch | Sucuri Blog").

This is caused by disuse of WordPress nonce.

### CSRF ###

A cause of <abbr title="Cross Site Request Forgeries">CSRF</abbr> is simple.

For example, if you click "Save Changes" on the admin screen, the page 
transition happens after saving the setting data into the DB.
In a sequence of these process, if no nonce is on the page before transition 
or no validation of nonce before saving data, CSRF immediately occurs.

In this case, only validation of user authentication or privilege at saving 
process can not prevent this vulnerability because an administrator potencially 
click a malicious link with own authorized cookie.

Disuse of nonce 
[leads many plugins to CSRF](https://wpvulndb.com/search?text=&vuln_type=3).

### File Inclusion ###

<abbr title="File Inclusion">FI</abbr> (or Arbitrary File Download) is a 
vulnerability that occurs by giving the user supplied input  without proper 
validation to some file system functions such as `file_get_contents()`.

On September 2014, 
[a vulnerability of Slider Revolution][Slider-Revolution]
became a big topic. For certain functions for the administrators, an attack 
could download any files via a request to `admin-ajax.php`.

{% highlight text %}
http://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=show-me&file=../wp-config.php
{% endhighlight %}

This request was handled with:

1. No validation of user privilege.
2. No validation of nonce.
3. No validation of given input.

As a result, the attacker could easily download `wp-config.php`.

[![Vulnerability of Slider Revolution]({{ "/img/2015-04/revslider.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
  "Vulnerability of Slider Revolution"
)][Slider-Revolution]

We can find this kind of vulnerability in the old version of 
[HD FLV Player][HD-FLV-Player]. In this plugin, `download.php` was called 
directly regardless of WordPress context where we should follow its event 
driven programming style to use appropriate functions to validate a nonce and 
user privilege.

### Conclusion ###

I've found a lot of disuse and misuse of WordPress core functions in 
[Sucuri Blog][Sucuri-Blog]
and conclude followings for developing WordPress plugins and themes.

* Input has been contaminated.
* The DB has also been contaminated.
* Secret information may leak.
* Administrator privileges also may leak and be stolen.
* Attacks may come from unexpected route.
* Attacker actually doesn't access to the page.
