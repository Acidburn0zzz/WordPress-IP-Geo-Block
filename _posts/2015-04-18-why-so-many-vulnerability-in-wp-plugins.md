The above graph shows recent statistics of WordPress vulnerability from 
[WPScan Vulnerability Database][WPScan] analyzed by [Sucuri][Sucuri] which 
is a world wide security company especially famous for analyzing WordPress 
vulnerability.

Why so many vulnerabilities are there in WP plugins?

After reading the [Sucuri Blog][Sucuri-Blog] widely and deeply, I came to 
the conclusion that there are some specific reasons to developping WordPress 
plugins.

### XSS ###

Unfortunately, <abbr title="cross site scripting">XSS</abbr> is very popular 
in WordPress plugins. In many cases, this occur with insufficient validation 
of untrusted data which comes from the outside (including from the DB) and 
lack of an escape just before responding to the user agent. The later is a 
fundamental countermeasure.

I make corresponding table between "[XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet][OWASP-XSS]" 
in OWASP and "[Data Validation][Data-Validation]" in Codex.

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Context</th>
        <th>Code Sample</th>
        <th>Defense</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>HTML body</td>
        <td><samp>&lt;div&gt;<code>DATA</code>&lt;/div&gt;</samp></td>
        <td><code>esc_html()</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>HTML attributes</td>
        <td><samp>&lt;input&hellip;value="<code>DATA</code>"&gt;</samp></td>
        <td><code>esc_attr()</code>, <code>sanitize_text_field()</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>GET parameter</td>
        <td><samp>&lt;a href="&hellip;?value=<code>DATA</code>"&gt;&hellip;&lt;/a&gt;</samp></td>
        <td><code>esc_url()</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>SRC/HREF attribute</td>
        <td><samp>&lt;iframe src="<code>DATA</code>" /&gt;</samp></td>
        <td><code>esc_url()</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>JavaScript Variable</td>
        <td><samp>&lt;script&gt;foo('<code>DATA</code>');&lt;/script&gt;</samp></td>
        <td><code>esc_js()</code></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>CSS Value</td>
        <td><samp>&lt;div style="width:<code>DATA</code>;"&gt;&hellip;&lt;/div&gt;</samp></td>
        <td>N/A</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

You already know this very well? Good!

When it comes to [XSS in Blubrry PowerPress <= 6.0][XSS-PowerPress], it was 
taken measures against XSS from a beginning. The following statistics shows 
before and after fixing XSS.

<div class="table-responsive text-right">
  <table class="table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>&nbsp;</th>
        <th>files</th>
        <th>lines</th>
        <th><code>htmlspecialchars()</code></th>
        <th><code>esc_html()</code></th>
        <th><code>esc_attr()</code></th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>before</td>
        <td>42</td>
        <td>36280</td>
        <td>274</td>
        <td>82</td>
        <td>153</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>after</td>
        <td>33</td>
        <td>22807</td>
        <td>160</td>
        <td>53</td>
        <td>131</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

In fact, those paches could be seen every where in their codes. It was hard to 
track before and after! Additionally, there were `htmlspecialchars()` and 
`esc_html()` mixed up.

Speaking about `esc_html()`, the third parameter to `htmlspecialchars()` is 
specified more strictly than their codes. I could hardly say it's OK or not 
if different character encoding is used.

Also it's important to design codes to separate like "Validating Input" in 
"Model" and "Escaping Output" in "View". Here I'm not saying about MVC but 
codex recomends to use 
"[Validating Sanitizing and Escaping User Data][Sanitizing-Escaping]" 
along the context and I think the context should be well designed.

### SQL Injection ###

On August 2014, Sururi team reported about 
[SQLi in Custom Contact Forms][Custom-Contact-Forms].

Here is the POC. It dumps the SQL for backup and download a previous one.

{% highlight php startinline=true %}
if (!is_admin()) { /* is front */
    ...
    $custom_contact_front = new CustomContactFormsFront();
    ...
} else { /* is admin */
    ...
    $custom_contact_admin = new CustomContactFormsAdmin();
    ...
    add_action('init', array(&$custom_contact_admin, 'adminInit'), 1);
}
 
function adminInit() {
    $this->downloadExportFile();
    $this->downloadCSVExportFile();
    $this->runImport();
}
{% endhighlight %}

The function `adminInit` is no doubt for administrators, but the codes had 
at least next five issues.

1. Validate user role by `is_admin()`.
2. Lack for assumption of unexpected access route.
3. Export and import without validating privilege.
4. Export raw SQL to the client.
5. Import raw SQL from the client.

As a result, an attacker can easyly know the DB prefix set in the 
`wp-config.php` and upload some malicious SQL to exploit the site.

[![Vulnerability of Custom Contact Form]({{ "/img/2015-04/custom-contact-form.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
  "Vulnerability of Custom Contact Form"
)][Custom-Contact-Forms]

This is caused by misunderstanding of `is_admin()` which indicate always 
`true` when someone access the admin area even with no authentication.

To avoid this vulnerability, the developer must follow the 
[SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet][OWASP-SQL] like below.

1. Validate user privilege by `current_user_can()` with `manage_options`.
2. Validate nonece to limit the access route.
3. Export and import validated and parameterized queries.
4. Use stored procedures.
5. Escape all user supplied input.

The action hook `admin_init` may cause similar misunderstanding. Sucuri reported 
related vulnerability of 
[RFI in MailPoet Plugin](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/07/remote-file-upload-vulnerability-on-mailpoet-wysija-newsletters.html "WordPress Security Vuln in MailPoet Plugin | Sucuri Blog")
on July 1 2014, and
[RCE in Platform theme](https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/01/security-advisory-vulnerabilities-in-pagelinesplatform-theme-for-wordpress.html "Security Advisory - Vulnerabilities in Pagelines/Platform theme for WordPress - Public Preview | Sucuri Blog")
on Jan 21 2015.

### Privilege Escalation ###

On February 3 2015, Sucuri disclosed 
[PE in UpdraftPlus plugin](https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/02/advisory-dangerous-nonce-leak-in-updraftplus.html "Advisory - Dangerous &quot;nonce&quot; leak in UpdraftPlus | Sucuri Blog").

Suppose a registered user hit the button on the dashboard to do something.

{% highlight php startinline=true %}
<form method="post" action="<?php echo admin_url( 'admin.php' ); ?>">
    <?php wp_nonce_field( 'foo-secret-nonce' ); ?>
    <input type="hidden" name="action" value="foo" />
    <input type="submit" value="Something to do" />
</form>
{% endhighlight %}

The function `foo_handler` will be triggered via action hook `admin_action_foo` 
by the following code when `wp-admin/?action=foo` is requested.

{% highlight php startinline=true %}
add_action( 'admin_action_foo', 'foo_handler' );
{% endhighlight %}

If the `foo-secret-nonce` is also used for an administrator function to do an 
important job and only `check_admin_referer('foo-secret-nonce')` is examined 
without validating the privilege, a PE will happen.

The same vulnerability in WPtouch was also 
[disclosed on July 14, 2014](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/07/disclosure-insecure-nonce-generation-in-wptouch.html "Disclosure: Insecure Nonce Generation in WPtouch | Sucuri Blog").

This is caused by misunderstanding of WordPress nonce.

### CSRF ###

A cause of <abbr title="Cross Site Request Forgeries">CSRF</abbr> is simple.

For example, if you click "Save Changes" on the admin screen, the page 
transition happens after saving the setting data into the DB.
In a sequence of these process, if no nonce is on the page before transition 
or no validation of nonce before saving data, CSRF immediately occurs.

In this case, only validation of authentication or privilege at saving process 
can not prevent this vulnerability because an administrator potencially click 
a malicious link with own authorized cookie.

This type of misunderstanding 
[leads many plugins to CSRF](https://wpvulndb.com/search?text=&vuln_type=3).

### File Inclusion ###

<abbr title="File Inclusion">FI</abbr> (or Arbitrary File Download) is a 
vulnerability that occurs by giving the input to some file system functions 
such as `file_get_contents()` without proper validation.

On September 2014, 
[a vulnerability of Slider Revolution][Slider-Revolution]
became a big topic. For certain functions for the administrators, an attack 
could download any files via a request to `admin-ajax.php`.

{% highlight text %}
http://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=show-me&file=../wp-config.php
{% endhighlight %}

This request was handled like followings.

1. No validation of user privilege.
2. No validation of nonce.
3. No validation of giving input.

As a result, the attacker could easily download `wp-config.php`.

[![Vulnerability of Slider Revolution]({{ "/img/2015-04/revslider.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
  "Vulnerability of Slider Revolution"
)][Slider-Revolution]

We can find this kind of vulnerability in the old version of 
[HD FLV Player][HD-FLV-Player]. In this plugin, `download.php` was called 
directly regardless of WordPress context where we should follow its event 
driven programming style to use appropriate functions to validate nonce and 
privilege.

### Conclusion ###

I've learned a lot of things from [Sucuri Blog][Sucuri-Blog] and conclude 
followings as a knowledge for developing WordPress plugins and themes.

* Input has been contaminated.
* The DB has also been contaminated.
* Secret information may leak.
* Administrator privileges also may leak and be stolen.
* Attacks may come from unexpected route.
* Attacker actually doesn't access to the page.
