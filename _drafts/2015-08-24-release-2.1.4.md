Sorry for frequent update but I had to fix the bug which broke functionality of 
certain plugins such as [Types][Types].

<!--more-->

### Fix the issue related to the action in form ###

[Types][Types] is very popular plugin, whose active installs is over 200,000.
It makes your job easier to handle the content types, custom fields and 
taxonomies.

[![Types]({{ "/img/2015-08/Types.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
  "Types"
)][Types]

But [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] had inappropriately handled the `action` 
attribute in form of Types. So [it seemed blocked when creating a custom field 
or something][forum]. (Thanks to [opsec][opsec] !!)

This issue will also happen with other plugins whenever the `action` in its 
forms is empty.

As for the specification, the current [HTML5 draft][html5-draft] says that:

> The action and formaction content attributes, if specified, **must have a 
> value that is a valid non-empty URL** potentially surrounded by spaces.

But empty `action` is not a rare case in HTML4. So it should be filled with the 
URL of the document and also authenticated information (i.e. nonce) to prevent 
a malicious access to the admin area.

In this release, empty `action` in HTML elements have been correctly handled.

### Improve UI based on a user perspective ###

In the early stages of development, this plugin has a singular function that 
blocks only spams from outside my country, and my main interest is which API 
should be used to get the country code from not only IPv4 addresses and but 
also IPv6.

Then "**Geolocation API settings**" was my first priority from the developer's 
point of view. Additionally in the previous version, each tab loads js and css 
files for [FooTable][FooTable]. But obviously it was bad for the site 
performance point of view.

![Optimized resouces]({{ "/img/2015-08/SettingsPage.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Optimized resouces"
)

So I have optimized those things base on a user perspective.
