<!--more-->

On December in 2017, the number of users of [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] have 
grown over 30,000. While being proud of this fact, I feel that this plugin 
should be improved much more because it is not ready to out-of-the-box.
The fact that the questions on the [forum][IPGB-Forum] related to the blocking 
behavior of this plugin have been increasing is telling about that.

I hope a new feature in this release can help to resolve the blocking issues 
when you have some experiences of unexpected blocking.

### New feature: "Find blocked requests" button ###

You can find the magnifying glass buttons <span class="emoji">
![Find blocked requests in “Logs”]({{ '/img/2018-01/find.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Find blocked requests in “Logs”")
</span> in "**Exceptions**" in "**Back-end target settings**" section.

![Find blocked request button]({{ '/img/2018-01/FindLogsButton.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Find blocked request button"
)

After clicking the button, you may find some additional items with an icon 
<span class="emoji">
![Find and verify on “Logs” tab]({{ '/img/2018-01/alert.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Find and verify on “Logs” tab")
</span> in list of "**Candidate actions/pages**". This icon means that there is
a blocked request with its name of the action or page in the Logs.

When you click the icon <span class="emoji">
![Find and verify on “Logs” tab]({{ '/img/2018-01/alert.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Find and verify on “Logs” tab"), a new window opens in order to verify if 
it's malicious or not. And after you confirm that it's safe to accept, you can 
specify it as "**Exceptions**" with its checkbox enabled.

The same feature is available in "**Plugins area**" and "**Themes area**" 
section.

Actually, this has almost the same meaning with error logs in 
"**Debug information**" which was equiped in [version 3.0.1][ReleaseVer301].
But I believe that it's huge better than before <span class="emoji">

)

### Improvement: UAlist in Logs ###

)
