Because I'm not a native english speaker, it is difficult to express something 
in English. After [some discussions[DISCUSSION] (many thanks to [John][JOHN]), 
I realized again that simple and straightforward is always the best

### New feature: Auto configuration of .htaccess ###

Previously, you should configure your `.htaccess` in your `plugins` and 
`themes` directories to [prevent malicious accesses against the PHP files]
[PREVENT] in those directories. But now you can just turn on the checkboxes 
"**Force to load WP core**".

![Force to load WP core by .htaccess]({{ '/img/2016-04/force-loading-wp.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Force to load WP core by .htaccess"
)

Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with **nginx**. So currently this feature is 
available only for **apache** but both should be supported in the future.

### New feature: Export / Import settings ###

"**Export settings**" button exports setting parameters which are displayed on 
the your browser to the json file. And "**Import settings**" button imports 
from the json file.

![Export / Import settings]({{ '/img/2016-04/plugin-settings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Export / Import settings"
)

The content in json file looks something like this:

{% highlight json starinline %}
{
    "ip_geo_block_settings[version]": "2.2.4",
    "ip_geo_block_settings[matching_rule]": "0",
    "ip_geo_block_settings[white_list]": "JP",
    "ip_geo_block_settings[black_list]": "ZZ",
    "ip_geo_block_settings[extra_ips][white_list]": "",
    "ip_geo_block_settings[extra_ips][black_list]": "",
    "ip_geo_block_settings[response_code]": "403",
    "ip_geo_block_settings[login_fails]": "5",
    ...
    "ip_geo_block_settings[clean_uninstall]": ""
}
{% endhighlight %}

These data will be validated on the server side to prevent XSS. I think this 
feature is useful for your multisite.

### Bug fix for multisite ###

Some links on the "**Networks admin dashboard**" would be blocked when you 
enabled "**Prevent zero-day exploit**" for "**Admin area**" or "**Admin 
ajax/post**".

Now this plugin is ready for multisite <span class="emoji">
