In this release, some new features and improvements have been implemented.
These are based on the feedbacks I got at the [support forum][forum] from 
my users.

<!--more-->

### Emergency function ###

This feature inhibits the blocking behavior of this plugin when you are locked 
out by misfortune.

Open the `ip-geo-block.php` using [appropriate editor][editors] and activate 
the code block at "**Emergent Functionality**" section at the bottom of the 
file as follows:

![Emergency function]({{ "/img/2015-08/EmergencyFunction.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Emergency function"
)

Replacing `/*` (opening multi-line comment) to `//` (single line comment) is 
also good. And save it then upload it to this plugin's directory on your server 
via FTP.

This trouble may be caused by a mismatch between the country code derived from 
your IP address and the rule of "**Validation settings**" on "**Settings**" tab.
It depends on the accuracy of geolocation database.

After reconfiguring those settings properly, do not forget to restore the 
`ip-geo-block.php` to the original.

### New feature on Settings tab ###

Now you can click a section title on "**Settings**" tab to flip settings open 
and close . And also you can check your IP address and country code  at 
"**Validation rule settings**".

![New settings tab]({{ "/img/2015-08/NewSettings.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "New settings tab"
)

### A wrong path at emergency ###

I strongly recommend the above mentioned feature at your emergency. However, 
all users are not familiar with editing PHP file. So I implemented another 
path to remove, reinstall and reactivate this plugin.

When you just remove `ip-geo-block` in your plugin's directory forcibly by 
using FTP or something, you'll see the following message on your plugin's 
dashboard.

![Force to delete]({{ "/img/2015-08/ForceDelete.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Force to delete"
)

Though you can reinstall and reactivate it, you'll notice that you are blocked 
again because your settings still remains in the mySQL database. But after 
pausing for breath, you can visit your admin dashboard again !!

A rescue process kicked by who has rigth permission to manage options will 
repair your settings in the mySQL database as a cron job.

### Removing unneeded query string ###

In the previous version, a query string was added to each static resource under 
the `wp-content/(plugins|themes)/` when you logged in as an administrator. This 
was bad for the site speed. But this query string is necessary for WP-ZEP. Now 
adding a query string is restricted to a request to the PHP file.

### Living with Autoptimize ###

[Autoptimize][AO] speeds up your site by aggregating and minimizing JS, CSS and 
HTML. In general, this functionarity has some delicate processes. For example, 
JS file whose name has a word "nonce" should be excluded in its cache because a 
nonce should not be kept in the cache.

So I changed the name of JS file from `auth-nonce.js` to `authenticate.js`.

### Conclusion ###

Your feedbacks always give me chances to improved this plugin. So please do not 
hesitate posting your annoyances at the [support forum][forum] <span class="emoji">
