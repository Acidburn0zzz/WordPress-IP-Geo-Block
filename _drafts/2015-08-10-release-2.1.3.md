In this release, 2 new features and 1 improvement have been implemented. These 
are based on the feedbacks I got at the [support forum][forum] from my users.

<!--more-->

### Emergency function ###

This feature inhibits the blocking behavior of this plugin when you are locked 
out by misfortune.

Open the `ip-geo-block.php` using [appropriate editor][editors] and activate 
the code block at "**Emergent Functionality**" section at the bottom of the 
file as follows:

![Emergency function]({{ "/img/2015-08/EmergencyFunction.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Emergency function"
)

Replacing `/*` (opening multi-line comment) to `//` (single line comment) is 
also good. And save it then upload it to this plugin's directory on your server 
via FTP.

This trouble may be caused by a mismatch between the country code derived from 
your IP address and the rule of "**Validation settings**" on "**Settings**" tab.
It depends on the accuracy of geolocation database.

After reconfiguring those settings properly, do not forget to restore the 
`ip-geo-block.php` to the original.

### New feature on Settings tab ###

Now you can click a section title on "**Settings**" tab to flip settings open 
and close . And also you can check your IP address and country code  at 
"**Validation rule settings**".

![New settings tab]({{ "/img/2015-08/NewSettings.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "New settings tab"
)

### Removing unneeded query string ###

In the previous version, a query string was added to each static resource under 
the `wp-content/(plugins|themes)/` when you logged in as an administrator. This 
was bad for the site speed. But this query string is necessary for WP-ZEP. So I 
restrict adding it to the PHP files.

Your feedbacks always give me chances to improved this plugin. So please do not 
hesitate posting your annoyances at the [support forum][forum] <span class="emoji">
