I'm very pleased to announce that now [IP Geo Block 3.0.3][IP-Geo-Block] has 
an ability of preventing against [Arbitrary File Upload][OWASP-AFU].

[Plugin Vulnerabilities][PluginVuln] have been reviewed [many WordPress plugin 
vulnerabilities][VulnReviews]. "[No WordPress Security Plugin Prevented 
Exploitation of Unfixed Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability in Popular Plugin]
[ReportAFU]"

> When you consider that vulnerabilities in plugins are a leading source of 
> WordPress websites being hacked (exploitation of vulnerabilities in WordPress 
> itself being few and far between), that means that relying on this plugin to 
> protect a website will leave it fairly vulnerable to a real threat.
