[RFC1939][RFC1939] defines an **autonomous system** as follows:

> Autonomous system is a connected group of one or more IP addresses run by 
> one or more network operators which has a single and clearly defined routing 
> policy.

And [autonomous system number (ASN)][AutoSys] is a registered entity supported 
by such as Internet Service Providers (ISP) or other large organizations that 
control blocks of IP addresses.

So we can make use of it to give permissions against the requests instead of 
specifing IP addresses or the ranage of them by [CIDR][CIDR].

### New feature: Use AS number ###

On the "**Settings**" tab, You can find a new option "**Use Autonomous System 
Number (ASN)**" in "**Validation rule settings**" section. After enabling it, 
you can specify the AS numbers in the "**Whitelist**" or "**Blacklist**" of 
"**extra IP addresses prior to country code**" as follows:

![AS number]({{ '/img/2017-08/ASNumber.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "AS number"
)

Note that usually [ISP][ISP], [SNS][SNS] and [search engines][WSE] provide 
many services and thus utilize different network groups. For example, [yahoo 
has registered many AS numbers][Yahoo]. So does [Google][Google]. And as for 
[Automattic][Automattic], they provide many services and [Jetpack][Jetpack] 
services should be covered with [multiple AS numbers][JetpackServ] which leads 
to include other services than Jetpack.

We should know that AS number doesn't always identify the specific organization
nor the services. It’s originally for routing the [IPs][IPS] to intervene 
different network groups.

[This plugin][IP-Geo-Block] also provides [**UA string and Qualification**][UAQ].
We have to find some good practices to use those functionalities properly.
It would be a bit complicated tasks. So I'd like to appreciate you if you share 
what you find <span class="emoji">

### New feature: Statistics in logs ###

You might be interested in "[WordPress Attack Report][AttackRepo]" at WordFence
blog. Yes, you can know what kind of attacks you had in your site similar to 
that report.

![Statistics in logs]({{ '/img/2017-08/StatisticsLogs.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Statistics in logs"
)

Clicking the links would naviate you to the details in **Logs** tab.

Enjoy your blocking life!! <span class="emoji">
