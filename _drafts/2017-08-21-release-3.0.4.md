[RFC1939][RFC1939] defines an **autonomous system** as follows:

> Autonomous system is a connected group of one or more IP addresses run by 
> one or more network operators which has a SINGLE and CLEARLY DEFINED routing 
> policy.

And [autonomous system number (ASN)][ASN] is a registered entity supported by 
such as Internet Service Providers (ISP) or other large organizations that 
control blocks of IP addresses.

So we can make use of it to give permissions against the requests instead of 
using the list of IP addresses or the ranage of them by [CIDR][CIDR].

<!--more-->

### New feature: Use AS number ###

On the "**Settings**" tab, You can find a new option "**Use Autonomous System 
Number (ASN)**" in "**Validation rule settings**" section. After enabling it, 
you can specify the AS numbers in the "**Whitelist**" or "**Blacklist**" of 
"**extra IP addresses prior to country code**" as follows:

![AS number]({{ '/img/2017-08/ASNumber.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "AS number"
)

Note that usually [ISP][ISP], [SNS][SNS] and [web search engine][WSE] provide 
many services through different network groups. For example, [yahoo has 
registered many AS numbers][Yahoo]. So does [Google][Google]. As for 
[Automattic][Automattic], [Jetpack][Jetpack] is run as a service on [multiple 
AS numbers][JetpackASN] which include other range of IP addresses than Jetpack 
needs.

Therefore we should notice that an AS number doesn't always identify the 
specific organization nor the services. It’s originally aimed for routing 
[IPs][IPS] to intervene information between different network groups.

On the other hand, [this plugin][IP-Geo-Block] also provides "[**UA string and 
Qualification**][UAQ]". For example, Google has many network groups registered 
as AS15169 which can be put into the "**Whitelist of extra IP addresses prior 
to country code**" to accept their bots. Instead of doing this, we can also 
put `Google:HOST` into "**UA string and Qualification**" as their host name 
can be looked up by its IP address.

![UA string and qualification]({{ '/img/2016-08/UA-Qualify.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "UA string and qualification"
)

So, we need find some good practices to utilize those functionalities.

I would appreciate you if you share what you find <span class="emoji">

</span>.

#### Server resource usage ####

This functionality needs additional seeking to dedicated databases. You can 
check its seek time at "**Search tab**" when you search an IP address.

![Seek time]({{ '/img/2017-08/SeekTime.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Seek time"
)

A seeked result would be kept in the cache of IP addresses. So I think it 
would not be so serious to the site performance.

On the other hand, the total size of DBs for IPv4 and IPv6 would be nearly 
10M bytes.

![DBs for AS number]({{ '/img/2017-08/ASN-DBs.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "DBs for AS number"
)

I'm afraid to say that I didn't provide you the functionality to delete those 
DBs. Please refer to the next section.

#### Deleting databases ####

If you do not need those DBs, please delete them directly in "[**Geolocation 
API library**][GeoAPILib]" folder using FTP or some kind of file manager like 
cPanel. Then make "**Use Autonomous System Number**" disabled and perform 
"**Save Changes**".

### New feature: Statistics in logs ###

You might be interested in "[WordPress Attack Report][AttackRepo]" at WordFence
blog. Just like this report, you can know what kind of attacks you had in your 
site.

![Statistics in logs]({{ '/img/2017-08/StatisticsLogs.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Statistics in logs"
)

Clicking the links would naviate you to the details on **Logs** tab.

![Statistics in Admin area]({{ '/img/2017-08/LogsAdminArea.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Statistics in Admin area"
)

I know I should provide a real time reporting feature in the future. For now, 
please be patient with this!

Until then, enjoy your blocking life!! <span class="emoji">
