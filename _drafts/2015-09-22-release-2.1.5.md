In the last release 2.1.4, I announced [the new feature to prevent self 
blocking][release214]. But this was not enough at the first installation.
Every user hates a product which suddenly shuts him/herself out right after 
the first installation. This was the reason why I got one <span class="emoji">

</span> at the [Reviews][BeCareful].

### <span id="sec1">Preventing self blocking at the first installation</span> ###

Actually, [the issue][BeCareful] was not a bug but the matter of desing.
For the user's convenience, this plugin will automatically set the proper 
country code into the white list when the user install it for the fist time.

In the previous release, when this plugin could not get the proper country 
code for some reasons from MaxMind database, it would try to use other Free 
Geolocation APIs until it got the proper one. But sometimes this mechanism 
would cause a issue because in such a case the country code is not stable 
amoung the APIs.

One of users, whose name is "internationils", gave me [a nice idea][nice-idea]:
"A button to scan all selected APIs for the current IP".

Yeah, that's a splendid idea !!
