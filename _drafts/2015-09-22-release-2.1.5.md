In the last release 2.1.4, I announced [the new feature to prevent self 
blocking][release214]. But this was not enough at the first installation.
Every user hates a product which suddenly shuts him/herself out right after 
the first installation. This was the reason why I got one <span class="emoji">

</span> at the [Reviews][BeCareful].

### <span id="sec1">Preventing self blocking at the first installation</span> ###

Actually, [the issue][BeCareful] was not a bug but the matter of design.
For the user's convenience, this plugin will automatically set the proper 
country code into the white list when the user install it for the fist time.

In the previous release, when this plugin could not get the proper country 
code for some reasons from MaxMind database, it would try to use other Free 
Geolocation APIs until it got the proper one. But sometimes this mechanism 
would cause an issue because in such a case the country code is not stable 
amoung the APIs.

Nils gave me [a nice suggestion][nice-idea]:

Yeah, that's a splendid idea !!

![Different country code]({{ "/img/2015-09/ScanCountry.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Different country code"
)

Yet even with this new feature, I can't decide if this plugin should put all 
the country codes into the list automatically, because there's a possibility 
that those codes would be undesired.

And futher more, if the ISP provides us a dynamic IP address, another 
possibility will come to block ourselves with this initial setting.

So I decided that the validation setting for "**Login form**" is to be 
"**Block by country (register, lost password)**" by default. It will prevent 
to block out a user who are logged in as an administrator.

I believe this design is the most balanced between convenient and inconvenient.

### <span id="sec2">Pie chart for "Blocked by countries"</span> ###

This is a substitution of a dull list for "**Blocked by countries**" using 
[Google Chart library][GoogleChart]. Although it's so not useful, I think it's 
better than to display poor list.

![Blocked by countries]({{ "/img/2015-09/PieChart.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Blocked by countries"
)

### <span id="sec3">Bug fix: Illegal handling of fragment in URL</span> ###

If you enables "**Prevent zero-day exploit**" for "**Admin area**", you would 
encounter the "**Forbidden**" message with a click at a certain link. It was 
caused by inappropriate handling for the [Fragment identifier][Fragment] in URL.

![URL with Fragment]({{ "/img/2015-09/URLwithFragment.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "URL with Fragment"
)

Now this issue has been fixed.
