I know [IP Geo Block][IP-Geo-Block] still has some compatibility issues between
2.2.9.1 and 3.0.0. So I've invested my time and energy in solving these issues.
In this release note, I'd introduce some of them that had been solved.

<!--more-->

### New feature: Exceptions for Admin ajax/post ###

The most frequent claim I've received in [support forum][SupportForum] is 
undesired blocking against some admin jobs on dashboard especially when you 
enable "[**Prevent Zero-day Exploit**][WP-ZEP]" named "WP-ZEP".

![Undesired blocking]({{ '/img/2017-03/AdminBlocking.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Undesired blocking"
)

Most of the cases can be solved by applying custom filter hook 
[`ip-geo-block-bypass-admins`][BypassAdmin] to bypass WP-ZEP. But you have to 
find the blocked page or action on "**Logs**" tab then put some code snippet 
into the `functions.php`.

![Blocked request in logs]({{ '/img/2017-03/BlockedRequestLogs.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Blocked request in logs"
)

From this release, you can just pick up actions in "**Exceptions**" at 
"**Admin ajax/post**" in order to avoid undesired blocking instead of putting 
code snippet.

![Exceptions for Admin ajax/post]({{ '/img/2017-03/AdminExceptions.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Exceptions for Admin ajax/post"
)

Note that a checked action that has only locked icon will pass through the 
validation of "**Prevent Zero-day Exploit**" but still "**Block by country**" 
will be in effective. And a checked action that has unlocked icon will bypass 
the validation of "**Block by country**".

Even both cases, the validation of "**Bad signature**" is still in effective.

### Improvement: Disabling limit login attempts ###

In the previous version, when you enabled "**Block by country**" for "**Login 
form**", limiting the number of login attempts was also enabled, and the lock 
out period would be the same as of the cache of IP address. So you could not 
configure the expiry period individually.

Now, you can disable "limit login attempts" of this plugin so that you can use 
other preferred plugin.

![Max number of failed login attempts]({{ '/img/2017-03/FailedLoginAttempts.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Max number of failed login attempts"
)

### Improvement: Download link of geolocation DB ###


![Download link of geolocation database]({{ '/img/2017-03/LocalDBSettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Download link of geolocation database"
)
