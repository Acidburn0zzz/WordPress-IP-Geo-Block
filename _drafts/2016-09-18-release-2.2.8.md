In the early version of this plugin, "**Search**" tab had been a kind of 
debugging tool for me to test accessing geolocation database through APIs.
On the other hand, it was not so uesful for users.

Now in this release, it becomes to be able to lookup reverse DNS data and 
whois database. Although these functionalities has been developed for 
[release 3.0.0][CallFor300], I decided to apply it to this release.

I believe it can help you to gain deep insight about the IP address of 
malicous access.

### Bug fix ###

Thanks to [@diegocanal who kindly reported the issue][IssueGmap] that 
"**Google Maps API key**" at "**Plugin settings**" stripped hyphens, now you 
can use some ASCII symbols such as `_-,:!.*/#+=` in all the text field in 
"**Settings**" tab.

### New feature: whois ###

Now you can find the links at IP addresses in "**Logs**" tab to jump to 
"**Search**" tab.

![interwork of logs and seach]({{ '/img/2016-09/LogsTab.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "interwork of logs and seach"
)

When you click the link, a new window opens to show whois information and 
geolocation of the IP address in "**Search**" tab.

![Whois results]({{ '/img/2016-09/whois.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Whois results"
)

Well, we can find several libraries to get whois information by php such as 
[Net_Whois in PEAR][PearWhois]. And we can also use the RESTful APIs served 
by some [Regional Internet Registries][WikiRIR] such as [ARIN][ARIN] and 
[RIPE NCC][RIPE-NCC].

Among these libraries and APIs, I decided to use [RIPE RESTful API][RIPE-API] 
because it's easy to use with JavaScript combined with [YQL], and the quality 
and quantity of its information seems to be well balanced than 
[ARIN RWS][ARIN-API]. Of course, as I showed a comment in the above picture, 
you can easily visit the original whois database source to get more detail 
information.

### New feature: Blocking target for login actions ###

In this release, you can individually specify the action such as `login`, 
`register`, `resetpasss`, `lostpassword` and `postpass`  as a blocking target 
at "**Login form**" in "**Validation target settings**".

![Login actions]({{ '/img/2016-09/LoginActions.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Login actions"
)

This makes the visibility of posts/pages to be controled more flexibly as 
password protected or private ones.

![Visibility setting]({{ '/img/2016-09/PostVisibility.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Visibility setting"
)

I hope you enjoy this release <span class="emoji">
