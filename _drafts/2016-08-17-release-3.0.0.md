As I anounced "[Call for testing 3.0.0 beta][CallFor300]" last month, I release
a new version which has a featured function "blocking on front-end".

<!--more-->

### New feature: Blocking on front-end ###

I just show you here how to deal with the requests on front-end. Here is the 
part of code that filters out the validation target. I had just added 
`'index.php' => 'public'` at the last part of the `$list`.

{% highlight ruby startinline %}
// Validate request to WordPress core files
$list = array(
    'wp-comments-post.php' => 'comment',
    'wp-trackback.php'     => 'comment',
    'xmlrpc.php'           => 'xmlrpc',
    'wp-login.php'         => 'login',
    'wp-signup.php'        => 'login',
    'index.php'            => 'public',
);
{% endhighlight %}

It's very simple and streight forward, isn't it?

### Living with caching plugin ###

As I showed above, the basic idea for blocking on front-end is very simple.
But it is not always easy to face real situation because of a caching plugin.

Currently, this plugin supports 
  [WP Super Cache][WP-Super-Cache],
  [W3 Total Cache][W3-Total-Cache] and
  [Wordfence][Wordfence]
with certain restrictions. For example, WP Super Cache must be configured to 
use PHP with "**Late init**".

![WP Super Cache]({{ '/img/2016-08/WP-Super-Cache.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "WP Super Cache")

For more detail, please refer to some documents "[Blocking on front-end]
[BlockFrontEnd]".

### New feature: Validation timing ###

You can select when to run the validation as one of these:

1. **"init" action hook**  
   Validate at init action hook same as typical plugins.

2. **"mu-plugins" (ip-geo-block-mu.php)**  
   Validate at an earlier stage than other plugins to reduce load of server.

![Validation timing]({{ '/img/2016-08/ValidationTiming.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Validation timing")

Indeed, `ip-geo-block-mu.php` will be installed into `wp-content/mu-plugins/` 
directory when you select 2. It means that this plugin will run prior to other
regular plugins and reduce the load of server when blocking succeeds.

#### Benchmark ####

I run a benchmark test about 2.2.6 vs 3.0.0 on my local PC about using 
[attack.sh][attack-sh] which is a wrapper of [ApacheBench][ApacheBench] 
but specialized for IP Geo Block. The configurations is same as "[Impact on 
server load caused by brute-force attacks][IMPACT-SERVER]" but under the 
following environment :

| Category      | Description                                                  |
|:--------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hardware      | MacBook Pro / 2.8GHz Core i7 / Memory 16GB                   |
| Software      | OS X 10.9.5 / MAMP Pro 3.5.2 (Apache 2.2.29, PHP 5.6.10)     |
| WordPress     | 4.5.3-ja / Site Language: English                            |
| Theme         | Child theme of Twenty Twelve (2.0)                           |
| Plugins       | Only IP Geo Block and WP Multibyte Patch (2.6) are activated |

The new features of IP Geo Block 3.0.0 are configured as follows : 

| Feature                                        | Configuration                    |
|:-----------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------|
|**Validation timing** [Validation rule settings]|"mu-plugins" (ip-geo-block-mu.php)|
|**Cache by cookie** [Cache settings]            |Enable                            |

Here is the result :

<div class="table-responsive">
	<table class="table">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th rowspan="2">Target</th>
				<th colspan="2">Requests/sec</th>
				<th colspan="2">Time/req [ms]</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>2.2.6</th>
				<th>3.0.0</th>
				<th>2.2.6</th>
				<th>3.0.0</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th><code>wp-comments-post.php</code></th>
				<td>10.28</td>
				<td>11.83</td>
				<td>97.246</td>
				<td>84.546</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th><code>xmlrpc.php</code></th>
				<td>10.80</td>
				<td>11.73</td>
				<td>92.570</td>
				<td>85.286</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th><code>xmlrpc.php (sys.multicall)</code></th>
				<td>10.54</td>
				<td>11.35</td>
				<td>94.864</td>
				<td>88.127</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th><code>wp-login.php</code></th>
				<td>10.41</td>
				<td>11.94</td>
				<td>96.104</td>
				<td>83.718</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th><code>admin-ajax.php</code></th>
				<td>10.79</td>
				<td>12.01</td>
				<td>92.702</td>
				<td>91.194</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
</div>

The performance had been improved about **11.5%** on average.

### Speed and Security ###

Definitely we need both of them. But it's difficult to strike a balance 
between them because a caching plugin would try to respond the contents 
without excuting any PHP codes at the very beggining of WordPress core 
proccess. That's why [Wordfence][Wordfence] provides their own caching 
system [Falcon Engine][FalconEngine].

I'm not satisfied with caching by PHP and late initialization. So I'd like to 
challenge to make speed compatible with security in the future but with a 
different way of Wordfence.
