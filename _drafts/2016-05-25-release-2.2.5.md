Since I already had mentioned about changes of 2.2.5 beta1 compared to 2.2.4.1 
in [the previous article][CallForTest], I don't have much about the release 
version except for the compatibility of downloading IP address database zip 
files for Microsoft IIS from [IP2Location][IP2Location].

### Compatibility of unzip ###

In the previous version, I used native [ZipArchive][ZipArchive] to unzip the 
IP address databases downloaded from [IP2Location LITE &trade;][IP2LocLite].

But my user [Greg][Greg] reported [the issue which was caused on windows IIS]
[ISSUE-ON-WIN].

Thanks to the WP core contributors, I use `[unzip_file()][UnzipFile]` that 
works fine on his Windows 2008 server with IIS 7. I don't know much about 
[WordPress on Microsoft IIS][WP-ON-IIS].

### Final thought ###

Since I built up my application development environment on my local PC that 
I mentioned in [this article][Confession], I become to have a lot of things 
to test use cases especially about multisite and SSL configurations.

Basically, WordPress can handle both "Sub-directory" type and "Sub-domain" 
type for multisite. For example, we can find the URLs both 
[https://wordpress.org/plugins/][WP-PLUGINS] and 
[https://codex.wordpress.org/][WP-CODEX], and those are based on 
[https://wordpress.org/][WP-ORG]. I don't know these sites share the same 
WordPress core. While this flexibility as a CMS brings us huge advantage, 
sometimes the complexity brings us developers the origin of the trouble
