The following charts (sorry, but it is based on the data in Apr. 2015) suggests 
that vulnerabilities in plugins are the top source of WordPress websites being 
exploited. And [Arbitrary File Upload][OWASP-AFU] that would directly causes 
websites hacked is the 3rd place among the type of vulnerabilities.

Now, I'm very pleased to announce that [IP Geo Block 3.0.3][IP-Geo-Block] 
has an ability to prevent [AFU][OWASP-AFU]!!

{% comment %}
The site "[Plugin Vulnerabilities][PluginVuln]" have been reviewed 
[many WordPress plugin vulnerabilities][VulnReviews] and said that 
"[No WordPress Security Plugin Prevented Exploitation of Unfixed 
Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability in Popular Plugin][ReportAFU]".

> When you consider that vulnerabilities in plugins are a leading source of 
> WordPress websites being hacked (exploitation of vulnerabilities in WordPress 
> itself being few and far between), that means that relying on this plugin to 
> protect a website will leave it fairly vulnerable to a real threat.

### New feature: Prevent malicious upload ###

Both [least privilege][LeastPriv] and whitelisting are the very basic strategy 
and tactics for every security perspectives. So does preventing malicious 
uploading.

Now you can find a new form "**Prevent malicious upload**" in "**Validation 
rule settings**" section. It enables to verify the capability (i.e. 
[`upload_files`][Capability]) and restrict the MIME types of uploading files.

![Configuration for Prevent malicious upload]({{ '/img/2017-05/PreventMaliciousUpload.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Configuration for Prevent malicious upload"
)

After you enable this feature, you may be supprised to find some malicious 
uploading within a few days. The following picutre shows that the attackers 
attempted to upload zip file including malware targeted at [vulnerability of 
Revolution Slider][RevSlider].

![Malicious uploading in logs]({{ '/img/2017-05/MaliciousUploadRequest.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Malicious uploading in logs"
)

Note that you need to put `FILES` into "**$_POST keys to be recorded with their
values in logs**" at "**Record settings**" section to record the content of 
[`$_FILES` PHP environment variable][PHP-FILES] like the above picture.

![RecordSettings]({{ '/img/2017-05/RecordSettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "RecordSettings"
)

Actually, [you can find many types of AFU][WP-Vulndb] in WPScan Vulnerability 
Database. Most cases utilized `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` as an entry point 
of malicious uploading. Some of them could be blocked by "[Zero-day Exploit 
Prevention][WP-ZEP]" but some of them could not in the previous version.

For example, the following table [reported in the past][Analysis] includes 
these type of vulnerability. WP-ZEP could not block the malicious uploading 
requests if a plugin would provid its service for both logged-in user (
<span class="emoji">
![emoji]({{ '/img/2017-03/LockedIcon.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
</span>) and not-logged-in user (<span class="emoji">
![emoji]({{ '/img/2017-03/UnlockedIcon.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
</span>).

But now, you're safe against this type of attacks!

)][Analysis]

### New feature: `ip-geo-block-forbidden-upload` ###

When this plugin detects malicious uploading, the filter hook 
[`ip-geo-block-forbidden-upload`][BadUpload] is applied.

I personally utilize it to make the uploaded files immune <span class="emoji">
![emoji](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f489.png)
</span> from public access and investigate them to study how websites would be 
exploited <span class="emoji">

</span>.

If you want to use this feature, do it at your own risk!
