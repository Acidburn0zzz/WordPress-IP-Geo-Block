I think vulnerabilities in plugins are the top source of WordPress websites 
being exploited, because the following charts (sorry, but this statistics is 
based on the data in Apr. 2015) shows [Arbitrary File Upload][OWASP-AFU] 
that directly causes websites hacked is the 3rd place among the type of 
vulnerabilities.

Now, I'm very pleased to announce that [IP Geo Block 3.0.3][IP-Geo-Block] 
has an ability to prevent [AFU][OWASP-AFU]!!

{% comment %}
The site "[Plugin Vulnerabilities][PluginVuln]" have been reviewed 
[many WordPress plugin vulnerabilities][VulnReviews] and said that 
"[No WordPress Security Plugin Prevented Exploitation of Unfixed 
Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability in Popular Plugin][ReportAFU]".

> When you consider that vulnerabilities in plugins are a leading source of 
> WordPress websites being hacked (exploitation of vulnerabilities in WordPress 
> itself being few and far between), that means that relying on this plugin to 
> protect a website will leave it fairly vulnerable to a real threat.

### New feature: Prevent malicious upload ###

Both [least privilege][LeastPriv] and whitelisting are very basic and strong 
strategy and tactics for every security perspectives. So does preventing 
malicious uploading.

Now you can find a new form "**Prevent malicious upload**" in "**Validation 
rule settings**" section. It enables to verify the capability for uploading 
files (i.e. [`upload_files`][Capability]) and restrict the allowed MIME types 
of files.

![Configuration for Prevent malicious upload]({{ '/img/2017-05/PreventMaliciousUpload.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Configuration for Prevent malicious upload"
)

After you enable this feature and you might be supprised to find malicious 
uploadings within a few days. The following picutre shows that the attackers 
attempted to upload zip file via [vulnerability of Revolution Slider][RevSlider].

![Malicious uploading in logs]({{ '/img/2017-05/MaliciousUploadRequest.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Malicious uploading in logs"
)

Note that you need to put `FILES` into "**$_POST keys to be recorded with their
values in logs**" at "**Record settings**" section to record the content of 
[`$_FILES` PHP environment variable][PHP-FILES] like the above picture.

![RecordSettings]({{ '/img/2017-05/RecordSettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "RecordSettings"
)

Well, [you can find many types of AFU][WP-Vulndb] in WPScan Vulnerability 
Database. Most cases utilized `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` as an entry point 
of malicious uploading. Some of them could be blocked by "[Zero-day Exploit 
Prevention][WP-ZEP]" but some of them could not.

For example, the following table that I reported in the past includes these 
type of vulnerability. WP-ZEP can't block the malicious uploading requests 
if a plugin would provid its service for both logged-in user (
<span class="emoji">
![emoji]({{ '/img/2017-03/LockedIcon.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
</span>) and not-logged-in user (<span class="emoji">
![emoji]({{ '/img/2017-03/UnlockedIcon.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
</span>). But now, you're safe against this type of attacks.

### New feature: `ip-geo-block-forbidden-upload` ###

When this plugin detects malicious uploading, the filter hook 
[`ip-geo-block-forbidden-upload`][BadUpload] is applied.

I personally utilize it to make the uploaded files immune <span class="emoji">
![emoji](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f489.png)
</span> from public access and investigate them to study how websites would be 
exploited <span class="emoji">
