The following chart (sorry, but it is based on the data in Apr. 2015) suggests 
that vulnerabilities in plugins are the top source of WordPress websites being 
exploited. This chart shows that [Arbitrary File Upload][OWASP-AFU] which may 
directly cause websites hacked is the 3rd place among the type of threats.

Sucuri also reported that backdoor and malware are the top 2 of infection 
trends in their report "[Website Hacked Trend Report 2016 - Q1][SUCURI]".

Now, I'm very pleased to announce that [IP Geo Block 3.0.3][IP-Geo-Block] 
has an ability to prevent those type of threats!!

{% comment %}
The site "[Plugin Vulnerabilities][PluginVuln]" have been reviewed 
[many WordPress plugin vulnerabilities][VulnReviews] and said that 
"[No WordPress Security Plugin Prevented Exploitation of Unfixed 
Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability in Popular Plugin][ReportAFU]".

> When you consider that vulnerabilities in plugins are a leading source of 
> WordPress websites being hacked (exploitation of vulnerabilities in WordPress 
> itself being few and far between), that means that relying on this plugin to 
> protect a website will leave it fairly vulnerable to a real threat.

### New feature: Prevent malicious upload ###

Both [least privilege][LeastPriv] and whitelisting are the very basic strategy 
and tactics for every security perspectives. So does preventing malicious 
uploading.

Now you can find a new option "**Prevent malicious upload**" in "**Validation 
rule settings**" section. It enables to verify the capability (i.e. 
[`upload_files`][Capability]) and restrict the MIME types of uploading files.

![Configuration for Prevent malicious upload]({{ '/img/2017-05/PreventMaliciousUpload.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Configuration for Prevent malicious upload"
)

After you enable this feature, you may be supprised to find some malicious 
uploading in the logs within a few days. The following picutre shows that 
the attackers attempted to upload zip file including malware targeted at 
[vulnerability of Revolution Slider][RevSlider].

![Malicious uploading in logs]({{ '/img/2017-05/MaliciousUploadRequest.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Malicious uploading in logs"
)

Note that you need to put `FILES` into "**$_POST keys to be recorded with their
values in logs**" at "**Record settings**" section to record the content of 
[`$_FILES` PHP environment variable][PHP-FILES] like the above picture.

![RecordSettings]({{ '/img/2017-05/RecordSettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "RecordSettings"
)

Actually, [you can find many types of AFU][WP-Vulndb] in WPScan Vulnerability 
Database. Most cases utilized `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` as an entry point 
of malicious uploading. Some of them could be blocked by "[Zero-day Exploit 
Prevention][WP-ZEP]" but some of them could not in the previous version.

For example, the following table [reported in the past][Analysis] includes 
these type of vulnerability. WP-ZEP could not block the malicious uploading 
requests if a plugin would provid its service for both logged-in user (
<span class="emoji">
![emoji]({{ '/img/2017-03/LockedIcon.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
</span>) and not-logged-in user (<span class="emoji">
![emoji]({{ '/img/2017-03/UnlockedIcon.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }})
</span>).

[![Analysis of Attack Vectors]({{ '/img/2017-05/AnalysisAttackVectors.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
  "Analysis of Attack Vectors"
)][Analysis]

But now, you're safe against this type of attacks!

![Malicious file upload in Logs]({{ '/img/2017-05/FileUploadLogs.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Malicious file upload in Logs"
)

#### How to configure ####

Logged in users can upload files on their dashboard which types are described 
in the [codex][UPLOAD-FILES].

![Network Settings]({{ '/img/2017-05/UploadFileSetting.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Network Settings"
)

But some plugins or themes which provide some uploading service potentially 
accept different kind of file types with their own verification of those 
content types. But sometimes the verification would fail or they loose to 
verify user's capability.

So "**Verify capability and MIME type**" will verify the [MIME type][MIMETYPE]
and file extension of uploaded files and also user [capability][Capability] 
on behalf of those vulnerable plugins and themes.

![All MIME Types]({{ '/img/2017-05/AllMimeTypes.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "All MIME Types"
)

If this configuration is too strong for your demand, "**Verify only file 
extension**" is your 2nd choice.

#### New hook: `ip-geo-block-forbidden-upload` ####

When this plugin detects malicious uploading, the filter hook 
[`ip-geo-block-forbidden-upload`][BadUpload] is applied.

I personally utilize it to make the uploaded files immune <span class="emoji">
![emoji](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f489.png)
</span> from public access and investigate them to study how websites would be 
exploited <span class="emoji">
![emoji](https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f48a.png)
</span>.

If you want to use this feature, do it at your own risk!

### New feature: "Response code" in front-end ###

This is useful not to violate your affiliate program.

### Improvement: Enabling/Disabling "DNS reverse lookup" ###
