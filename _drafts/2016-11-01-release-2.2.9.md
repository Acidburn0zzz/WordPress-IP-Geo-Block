I expect that this is a final version which would be released before [3.0.0]
[CallFor300]. To put it in other words, this version includes some crucial 
features towards 3.0.0 for both performance and ability. So every user is 
expected to update!

### New feature: Validation timing ###

You can select when to run the validation as one of these:

1. **"init" action hook**  
   Validate at init action hook same as typical plugins.

2. **"mu-plugins" (ip-geo-block-mu.php)**  
   Validate at an earlier stage than other plugins to reduce load of server.

![Validation timing]({{ '/img/2016-08/ValidationTiming.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Validation timing")

Indeed, `ip-geo-block-mu.php` will be installed into `wp-content/mu-plugins/` 
directory when you select 2. It means that this plugin will run prior to other
regular plugins and reduce the load of server when blocking succeeds.

#### Benchmark ####

I run a benchmark test on my local PC using [attack.sh][attack-sh] which is a 
wrapper of [ApacheBench][ApacheBench] but specialized for IP Geo Block under 
the following environment :

| Category      | Description                                                  |
|:--------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hardware      | MacBook Pro / 2.8GHz Core i7 / Memory 16GB                   |
| Software      | OS X 10.9.5 / MAMP Pro 3.5.2 (Apache 2.2.29, PHP 5.6.10)     |
| WordPress     | 4.6.1-ja / Site Language: English                            |
| Theme         | Child theme of Twenty Twelve (2.0)                           |

All the installed and activated plugins are :

![Installed Plugins]({{ '/img/2016-10/InstalledPlugins.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Installed Plugins")

And the options of IP Geo Block 2.2.9 are configured by "**Best practice**".

![Plugin settings]({{ '/img/2016-10/PluginSettings.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Plugin settings")

Here is the result (**OFF** indicates "deactivate") :

<div class="table-responsive">
	<table class="table">
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th rowspan="2">Target</th>
				<th colspan="3">Requests/sec</th>
				<th colspan="3">Time/req [ms]</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>OFF</th>
				<th>INIT</th>
				<th>MU</th>
				<th>OFF</th>
				<th>INIT</th>
				<th>MU</th>
			</tr>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th><code>wp-comments-post.php</code></th>
				<td>4.17</td>
				<td>4.38</td>
				<td>9.49</td>
				<td>240.08</td>
				<td>228.40</td>
				<td>105.37</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th><code>xmlrpc.php</code></th>
				<td>3.98</td>
				<td>4.38</td>
				<td>9.63</td>
				<td>251.19</td>
				<td>228.11</td>
				<td>103.88</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th><code>xmlrpc.php (sys.multicall)</code></th>
				<td>3.37</td>
				<td>4.32</td>
				<td>7.90</td>
				<td>296.40</td>
				<td>231.48</td>
				<td>126.60</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th><code>wp-login.php</code></th>
				<td>4.13</td>
				<td>4.45</td>
				<td>9.54</td>
				<td>242.14</td>
				<td>224.73</td>
				<td>104.82</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th><code>admin-ajax.php</code></th>
				<td>3.60</td>
				<td>4.16</td>
				<td>9.43</td>
				<td>277.91</td>
				<td>240.15</td>
				<td>106.04</td>
			</tr>
		</tbody>
	</table>
</div>

The performance had been improved about **47.42%** on average.

### Improvement: "Bad signature" for XSS ###

There're [a lot of patterns][OWASP-XSS] which cause XSS. So it's hard to filter 
out those patterns from the requested URIs by general rules because they depend 
on the context which comes into view. For example, [Wordfence][Wordfence] blocks
the query when you put the word `<script>` into the search box.

![Search forbidden]({{ '/img/2016-10/SearchScript.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Search forbidden")

On the other hand, you can search `onmouse="alert('XSS')"` which is another 
potential XSS pattern.

![Search not found]({{ '/img/2016-10/SearchOnmouse.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Search not found")

In case of this plugin, the filtering rule is more restrictive than Wordfence.
It means that you can search `<script>` or `<script> </script>` but would be 
blocked when you put `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into the search box.
