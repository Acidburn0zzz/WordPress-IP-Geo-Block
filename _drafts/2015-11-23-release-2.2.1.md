Although [IP Geo Block 2.2.1][IP-Geo-Block] isn't so attractive for you 
because there's no new feature except several bug fixes, it includes a very 
important alteration related to the IP address geolocation API for local 
databases of [Maxmind][Maxmind] and [IP2Location][IP2Location].

In this changelog, I'll mention about it.

<!--more-->

### <span id="sec1">Replacement of the directory for local databases</span> ###

In the previous version, geolocation database files are located at as follows:

* Maxmind  
  `wp-content/plugins/ip-geo-block/database/`
* IP2Location  
  `wp-content/plugins/ip2location-{tags|variables|blocker}/`

With this configuration, the Maxmind DBs will always be removed and downloaded 
at every upgrading of this plugin.

Now, those DBs can be placed outside this plugin e.g. `wp-content/ip-geo-api/` 
to cut the above useless process. And also the class libraries for DBs can be 
put under that directory. It means that the class libraries and DBs have become 
independent of this plugin. You can get them from [WordPress-IP-Geo-API]
[IP-Geo-API].

#### <span id="sec1.1">Filter hook for DBs</span> ####

You can use the following filter hooks to customize the settings of your DBs 
around.

* `ip-geo-block-api-dir`  
  full path to the class libraries and local DB files.
* `ip-geo-block-maxmind-dir`  
  full path where Maxmind GeoLite DB files should be saved.
* `ip-geo-block-ip2location-dir`  
  full path where IP2Location LITE DB files should be saved.
* `ip-geo-block-ip2location-path`  
  full path to IP2Location LITE DB file (IPv4).

{% highlight php startinline %}
function my_geodbs_dir( $dir ) {
    $upload = wp_upload_dir();
    return $upload['basedir'];
}
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-maxmind-dir',     'my_geodbs_dir' );
add_filter( 'ip-geo-block-ip2location-dir', 'my_geodbs_dir' );
{% endhighlight %}

<!-- bug? -->

</div>

You should always **deactivate then activate again** when you change your 
settings.

#### <span id="sec1.2">Option page</span> ####

You can check your configuration for DBs at this plugin's option page.

![Local database settings]({{ "/img/2015-11/local-db-settings.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Local database settings"
)

### <span id="sec2">Don't you need different types of DBs?</span> ###

In my observation on coverage for IPv6, Maxmind is better than IP2Location.
In any case, the coverage of each DB might be limited by their data sources.
So something fallback might be needed.

If you don't want one of these, please remove `ip-geo-api/maxmind` or 
`ip-geo-api/ip2location` and this plugin would not download it any more.
