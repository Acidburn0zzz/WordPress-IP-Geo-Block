As I anounced "[Call for testing 3.0.0 beta][CallFor300]" last month, I release
a new version which has a featured function "blocking on front-end".

<!--more-->

### New feature: Blocking on front-end ###

I just show you here how to deal with the requests on front-end. Here is the 
part of code that filters out the validation target. I had just added 
`'index.php' => 'public'` at the last part of the `$list`.

{% highlight ruby startinline %}
// Validate request to WordPress core files
$list = array(
    'wp-comments-post.php' => 'comment',
    'wp-trackback.php'     => 'comment',
    'xmlrpc.php'           => 'xmlrpc',
    'wp-login.php'         => 'login',
    'wp-signup.php'        => 'login',
    'index.php'            => 'public',
);
{% endhighlight %}

It's very simple and streight forward, isn't it?

### Living with caching plugin ###

As I showed above, the basic idea for blocking on front-end is very simple.
But it is not always easy to face real situation because of a caching plugin.

Currently, this plugin supports 
  [WP Super Cache][WP-Super-Cache],
  [W3 Total Cache][W3-Total-Cache] and
  [Wordfence][Wordfence]
with certain restrictions. For example, WP Super Cache must be configured to 
use PHP with "**Late init**".

![WP Super Cache]({{ '/img/2016-08/WP-Super-Cache.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "WP Super Cache")

For more detail, please refer to some documents "[Blocking on front-end]
[BlockFrontEnd]".

### New feature: Validation timing ###

You can select when to run the validation as one of these:

1. **"init" action hook**  
   Validate at init action hook same as typical plugins.

2. **"mu-plugins" (ip-geo-block-mu.php)**  
   Validate at an earlier stage than other plugins to reduce load of server.

![Validation timing]({{ '/img/2016-08/ValidationTiming.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "Validation timing")

Indeed, `ip-geo-block-mu.php` will be installed into `wp-content/mu-plugins/` 
directory when you select 2. It means that this plugin will run prior to other
regular plugins and reduce the load of server when blocking succeeds.

### Speed and Security ###

Definitely we need both of them. But it's difficult to strike a balance 
between them because a caching plugin would try to respond the contents 
without excuting any PHP codes at the very beggining of WordPress core 
proccess. That's why [Wordfence][Wordfence] provides their own caching 
system [Falcon Engine][FalconEngine].

I'm not satisfied with caching by PHP and late initialization. So I'd like to 
challenge to make speed compatible with security in the future but with a 
different way of Wordfence.
