As I anounced "[Call for testing 3.0.0 beta][CallFor300]" before, I release a 
new version which is almost the same as 3.0.0 beta but the featured function 
"blocking on front-end" is still under beta.

Why?

Well, because my ideal goal of 3.0.0 is far from 3.0.0 beta which slightly 
extended the previous version 2.2.6. So I changed my plan.

<!--more-->

### New feature: Blocking on front-end ###

I just show you here how to deal with the requests on front-end in this 
release.

{% highlight ruby startinline %}
// Validate request to WordPress core files
$list = array(
    'wp-comments-post.php' => 'comment',
    'wp-trackback.php'     => 'comment',
    'xmlrpc.php'           => 'xmlrpc',
    'wp-login.php'         => 'login',
    'wp-signup.php'        => 'login',
    'index.php'            => 'public',
);
{% endhighlight %}

I had just added `'index.php' => 'public'` at the last part of the `$list`.

### Living with caching plugin ###

As I showed above, the basic idea for blocking on front-end is very simple.
But it is not always easy to face reality because of caching plugins.

Currently, this plugin can support 
  [WP Super Cache][WP-Super-Cache],
  [W3 Total Cache][W3-Total-Cache] and
  **Basic Caching** in [Wordfence][Wordfence]
with the following configuration.

| Name             | Configuration                                                  |
|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
| WP Super Cache   | "**Use PHP to serve cache files**" and "**Late init**"         |
| W3 Total Cache   | "**Disk: Basic**" and "**Late initialization**" for page cache |
| Wordfence Falcon | "**Basic Caching**" and `ip-geo-block-mu.php` in `mu-plugins`  |

![WP Super Cache]({{ '/img/2016-08/WP-Super-Cache.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "WP Super Cache")

In anther words, this plugin expects that:

- Caching must be served by PHP (not by `mod_rewrite`).

- "**Late initialization**" is required when `advanced-cache.php` drop-in
  is used. (WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache)

- `ip-geo-block-mu.php` must be put into the `mu-plugins` especially when
  "**Late initialization**" is not supported. (Wordfence)

You can find the `ip-geo-block-mu.php` file at `wp-content/mu-plugins` in the 
distributed package of this plugin. Using this file is always recommended 
even in case of WP Super Cache and W3 Total Cache because of the performance 
reason.

### Speed and Security ###

Definitely we need both of them. But these are difficult to work with because 
a caching plugin would try to respond the contents without excuting any PHP 
codes at the very beggining of WordPress core proccess. That's why [Wordfence]
[Wordfence] provides their own caching mechanism [Falcon Engine][FalconEngine].

Because of the same reason as Wordfence equips Falcon Engine, I'd like to 
challenge to make speed compatible with security in the future but with a 
different way of Wordfence.
