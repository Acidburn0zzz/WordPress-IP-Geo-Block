### Admin lock out by brute-force attack with same IP ###

At [support forum][IssueLockOut] I got an issue which caused self blocking 
right after this plugin's upgrade from 2.2.9.1 to 3.0.0. It seemed to happen 
because of "**Limited**" which means:

> The number of login attempts reached to the limit.

Theoretically, it could happen if the dynamically assigned IP address was 
shared between admin and attacker. But of course, it's almost unlikely to 
happen.

So I examined http load testing on my local server to emulate brute-force 
attacks using [Apache Bench command][ApacheBench] at about 700 requests per 
minute. I had done dozens of test sets and I had only one unreasonable error 
which was:

> PHP Warning: ...

I also tested the previous version 2.2.9.1 as same number of sets and I got 
an error:

> ...

This error was fetched in `wp-includes/...`, and quite reasonable.

The difference between those two version related to this issue is the timing 
when to write the cached IP address back to the MySQL DB which command would 
be issued just before responding the attacker in 2.2.9.1 whihe just at 
[shutdown action hook][ShutdownHook] triggered after WP process die in 3.0.0.

So I decided to revise this timing in 3.0.0 as same as 2.2.9.1. I can't say 
this change can fix the issue for certain but should do it.

#### Fallback functionality ####

Unfortunately when you encountered the above issue during you're logged in, 
not only 3.0.0 but also 2.2.9.1 would end in the same result as follows:

But in this release, you can see the following warning on admin dashboard:

So you can safely clear logs before you're logged out.

### Installation information ###

As you know, this plugin potencially have some issues that should be improved.
When you meet them, I always would appreciate to let me know some infomations 
about your site at [support forum][SupportForum].

So I made a button to gather some useful information and make it easy to 
subscribe those at forum by copy &amp; paste.

Please feel free to use it.
