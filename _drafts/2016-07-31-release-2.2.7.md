Although I anounced "[Call for testing 3.0.0 beta][CallFor300]", I'd release 
this version which is almost the same as 3.0.0 beta but provides the function 
of "blocking front-end" for beta. Why? Well, because my ideal goal of 3.0.0 is 
far from 3.0.0 beta which slightly extended the previous version 2.2.6. So I 
changed my plan.

### TL;DR ###

I'd just show you how to deal with the front-end in this release.

{% highlight ruby startinline %}
// Validate request to WordPress core files
$list = array(
    'wp-comments-post.php' => 'comment',
    'wp-trackback.php'     => 'comment',
    'xmlrpc.php'           => 'xmlrpc',
    'wp-login.php'         => 'login',
    'wp-signup.php'        => 'login',
    'index.php'            => 'public',
);
{% endhighlight %}

I had added `'index.php' => 'public'` at the last part of the `$list`.

### Speed and Security ###

Definitely we need both of them. But these are difficult to work with because 
a caching plugin would try to respond the contents without excuting any PHP 
codes at the very beggining of WordPress core proccess. That's why [Wordfence]
[Wordfence] provides their own caching mechanism [Falcon Engine][FalconEngine].

Actually, this release requires the caching plugin to use **PHP** and **late 
initialization**.

![WP Super Cache]({{ '/img/2016-08/WP-Super-Cache.png' | prepend: site.baseurl }}
 "WP Super Cache")

It means that the following plugins and caching mode are supported.

| Name             | Caching mode                                                   |
|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
| WP Super Cache   | "**Use PHP to serve cache files**" and "**Late init**"         |
| W3 Total Cache   | "**Disk: Basic**" and "**Late initialization**" for page cache |
| Wordfence Falcon | "**Basic Caching**" for caching at Performance setup           |

### My future challenge ###

I'm not satisfied with caching by PHP and late initialization. So I'd like to 
challenge a different way of Wordfence to make speed compatible with security 
in the future.
